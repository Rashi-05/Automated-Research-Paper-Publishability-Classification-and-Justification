This concept, which has only recently been defined, has\\nalready demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time.\\nWe establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method (OGDA) within\\nthis framework, achieving a convergence rate of 1/k for the most effective iteration, measured by the squared\\noperator norm, a result that aligns with the extragradient method (EG). Furthermore, we introduce a modified\\nversion of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problem\\u2019s\\nspecific parameters.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems,\\nhave generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks,\\nadversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developed\\nthat generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization\\ncomponent and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability in\\ncertain cases.\\nA specific subset of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was analyzed, and it was found that the extragradient method (EG)\\nexhibited favorable convergence behavior in experimental settings. Surprisingly, these problems did not appear to possess any of\\nthe recognized favorable characteristics, such as monotonicity or Minty solutions. Subsequently, a suitable concept was identified\\n(see Assumption 1), which is less restrictive than the presence of a Minty solution (a condition frequently employed in the existing\\nliterature) and also extends the idea of negative comonotonicity. Because of these properties that unify and generalize, the concept of\\nweak Minty solutions was quickly investigated.\\nAssumption 1 (Weak Minty solution). For a given operator F:Rd\\u2192Rd, there is a point u\\u2217\\u2208Rdand a parameter \\u03c1 >0such that:\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u2265 \\u2212\\u03c1\\n2\\u2225F(u)\\u22252\\u2200u\\u2208Rd. (1)\\nMoreover, it has been demonstrated that a modified version of EG is capable of addressing problems with such solutions, achieving\\na complexity of O(\\u03f5\\u22121)for the squared operator norm. This adaptation, referred to as EG+, is based on a bold extrapolation step\\nfollowed by a cautious update step. A similar step size approach has been previously examined in the context of a stochastic variant\\nof EG.\\nIn a similar vein, we explore a variation of the optimistic gradient descent ascent (OGDA), also known as Forward-Reflected-\\nBackward (FoRB). We address the following question with an affirmative answer:\\nCan OGDA achieve convergence guarantees comparable to those of EG when dealing with weak Minty solutions?\\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that a modified version of the OGDA method, defined for a step size a >0and a parameter 0< \\u03b3\\u22641\\nas follows:\\nuk= \\u00afuk\\u2212aF(\\u00afuk),\\n\\u00afuk+1= \\u00afuk\\u2212\\u03b3aF(uk),\\u2200k\\u22650,\\ncan achieve the same convergence bounds as EG+ by requiring only a single gradient oracle call in each iteration.\\nIt is worth noting that OGDA is most frequently expressed in a form where \\u03b3= 1. However, two recent studies have examined\\na more generalized coefficient. While these earlier studies focused on the monotone setting, the true significance of \\u03b3becomesapparent only when dealing with weak Minty solutions. In this context, we find that \\u03b3must be greater than 1 to ensure convergence,\\na phenomenon that is not observed in monotone problems.\\nWhen examining a general smooth min-max problem:\\nmin\\nxmax\\nyf(x, y)\\nthe operator Fmentioned in Assumption 1 naturally emerges as F(u) := [\\u2207xf(x, y),\\u2212\\u2207yf(x, y)]withu= (x, y). However,\\nby examining saddle point problems from the broader viewpoint of variational inequalities (VIs) through the operator F, we can\\nconcurrently address more scenarios, such as certain equilibrium problems.\\nThe parameter \\u03c1in the definition of weak Minty solutions (1) is crucial for both the analysis and the experiments. Specifically, it\\nis essential that the step size exceeds a value proportional to \\u03c1. Simultaneously, as is typical, the step size is limited from above\\nby the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of F. For instance, since some researchers require the step size to be less than1\\n4L, their\\nconvergence claim is valid only if \\u03c1 <1\\n4L. This condition was later improved to \\u03c1 <1\\n2Lfor the choice \\u03b3= 1and to \\u03c1 <1\\nLfor\\neven smaller values of \\u03b3. As in the monotone setting, OGDA requires a smaller step size than EG. Nevertheless, through a different\\nanalysis, we are able to match the most general condition on the weak Minty parameter \\u03c1 <1\\nLfor appropriate \\u03b3anda.\\n1.1 Contribution\\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\\n1.We establish a new convergence rate of O(1/k), measured by the squared operator norm, for a modified version of OGDA,\\nwhich we call OGDA+. This rate matches that of EG and builds upon the recently introduced concept of weak solutions to\\nthe Minty variational inequality.\\n2.Even when a stronger condition is imposed, specifically that the operator is also monotone, we enhance the range of feasible\\nstep sizes for OGDA+ and obtain the most favorable result known for the standard method ( \\u03b3= 1).\\n3. We demonstrate a complexity bound of O(\\u03f5\\u22122)for a stochastic variant of the OGDA+ method.\\n4.We also introduce an adaptive step size version of EG+. This version achieves the same convergence guarantees without\\nrequiring any knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the operator F. Consequently, it can potentially take larger steps in\\nareas with low curvature, enabling convergence where a fixed step size strategy might fail.\\n1.2 Related literature\\nWe will concentrate on the nonconvex-nonconcave setting, as there is a substantial body of work on convergence rates in terms of a gap\\nfunction or distance to a solution for monotone problems, as well as generalizations such as nonconvex-concave, convex-nonconcave,\\nor under the Polyak-\\u0141ojasiewicz assumption.\\nWeak Minty. It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution,\\ntermed \\\"weak Minty,\\\" without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions.\\nConvergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as\\nthe update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the\\nlength of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search is\\nalso proposed, which may incur extra gradient computations or require second-order information (in contrast to the adaptive step\\nsize we propose in Algorithm 3). A different approach is taken by focusing on the min-max setting and using multiple ascent steps\\nper descent step, achieving the same O(1/k)rate as EG.\\nMinty solutions. Numerous studies have presented various methods for scenarios where the problem at hand has a Minty solution.\\nIt was shown that weakly monotone VIs can be solved by iteratively adding a quadratic proximity term and repeatedly optimizing\\nthe resulting strongly monotone VI using any convergent method. The convergence of the OGDA method was proven, but without a\\nspecific rate. It was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm (GRAAL) is valid without any changes. While\\nthe assumption that a Minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting, it is challenging to find non-monotone\\nproblems that possess such solutions. In our setting, as per Assumption 1, the Minty inequality (MVI) can be violated at any point\\nby a factor proportional to the squared operator norm.\\nNegative comonotonicity. Although previously studied under the term \\\"cohypomonotonicity,\\\" the concept of negative comono-\\ntonicity has recently been explored. It offers a generalization of monotonicity, but in a direction distinct from the concept of Minty\\nsolutions, and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context. An anchored version of EG was studied, and\\nan improved convergence rate of O(1/k2)(in terms of the squared operator norm) was shown. Similarly, an accelerated version of\\nthe reflected gradient method was investigated. Whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak Minty\\nsolutions remains an open question (any Stampacchia solution to the VI given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak Minty\\nsolution). Another intriguing observation was made, where for cohypomonotone problems, a monotonically decreasing gradient\\nnorm was demonstrated when using EG. However, we did not observe this in our experiments, emphasizing the need to differentiate\\nthis class from problems with weak Minty solutions.\\n2Interaction dominance. The concept of \\u03b1-interaction dominance for nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was investigated,\\nand it was shown that the proximal-point method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in yand linearly if it is met in both\\ncomponents. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components, it is also negatively\\ncomonotone.\\nOptimism. The positive effects of introducing the simple modification commonly known as optimism have recently attracted the\\nattention of the machine learning community. Its name comes from online optimization. The idea dates back even further and has\\nalso been studied in the mathematical programming community.\\n2 Preliminaries\\n2.1 Notions of solution\\nWe outline the most frequently used solution concepts in the context of variational inequalities (VIs) and related areas. These\\nconcepts are typically defined with respect to a constraint set C\\u2286Rd. A Stampacchia solution of the VI given by F:Rd\\u2192Rdis a\\npoint u\\u2217such that:\\n\\u27e8F(u\\u2217), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u22650\\u2200u\\u2208C. (SVI)\\nIn this work, we only consider the unconstrained case where C=Rd, and the above condition simplifies to F(u\\u2217) = 0 . Closely\\nrelated is the following concept: A Minty solution is a point u\\u2217\\u2208Csuch that:\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u22650\\u2200u\\u2208C. (MVI)\\nFor a continuous operator F, a Minty solution of the VI is always a Stampacchia solution. The converse is generally not true but\\nholds, for example, if the operator Fis monotone. Specifically, there are nonmonotone problems with Stampacchia solutions but\\nwithout any Minty solutions.\\n2.2 Notions of monotonicity\\nThis section aims to revisit some fundamental and more contemporary concepts of monotonicity and the relationships between them.\\nAn operator Fis considered monotone if:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u22650.\\nSuch operators naturally arise as the gradients of convex functions, from convex-concave min-max problems, or from equilibrium\\nproblems.\\nTwo frequently studied notions that fall into this category are strongly monotone operators, which satisfy:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265\\u00b5\\u2225u\\u2212v\\u22252,\\nand cocoercive operators, which fulfill:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265\\u03b2\\u2225F(u)\\u2212F(v)\\u22252. (2)\\nStrongly monotone operators emerge as gradients of strongly convex functions or in strongly-convex-strongly-concave min-max\\nproblems. Cocoercive operators appear, for instance, as gradients of smooth convex functions, in which case (2) holds with \\u03b2equal\\nto the inverse of the gradient\\u2019s Lipschitz constant.\\nDeparting from monotonicity. Both of the aforementioned subclasses of monotonicity can serve as starting points for exploring\\nthe non-monotone domain. Given that general non-monotone operators may display erratic behavior, such as periodic cycles and\\nspurious attractors, it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable. First and\\nforemost is the extensively studied setting of \\u03bd-weak monotonicity:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265 \\u2212 \\u03bd\\u2225u\\u2212v\\u22252.\\nSuch operators arise as the gradients of the well-studied class of weakly convex functions, a rather general class of functions as it\\nincludes all functions without upward cusps. In particular, every smooth function with a Lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill this\\nproperty. On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity,\\nhas received much less attention and is given by:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265 \\u2212 \\u03b3\\u2225F(u)\\u2212F(v)\\u22252.\\nClearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1.\\nBehavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficient\\nto require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead of\\nmonotonicity, it is enough to ask for the operator Fto be star-monotone, i.e.,\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u22650,\\nor star-cocoercive,\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u2265\\u03b3\\u2225F(u)\\u22252.\\nIn this spirit, we can provide a new interpretation to the assumption of the existence of a weak Minty solution as asking for the\\noperator Fto be negatively star-cocoercive (with respect to at least one solution). Furthermore, we want to point out that while the\\nabove star notions are sometimes required to hold for all solutions u\\u2217, in the following we only require it to hold for a single solution.\\n33 OGDA for problems with weak Minty solutions\\nThe generalized version of OGDA, which we denote with a \\\"+\\\" to emphasize the presence of the additional parameter \\u03b3, is given by:\\nAlgorithm 1 OGDA+\\nRequire: Starting point u0=u\\u22121\\u2208Rd, step size a >0and parameter 0< \\u03b3 < 1.\\nfork= 0,1, ...do\\nuk+1=uk\\u2212a((1 + \\u03b3)F(uk)\\u2212F(uk\\u22121))\\nend for\\nTheorem 3.1.

To be able to choose a large step size a, we must decrease \\u03b3, as evident from (3). However, this degrades the algorithm\\u2019s\\nspeed by making the update steps smaller. The same effect can be observed for EG+ and is therefore not surprising. One could\\nderive an optimal \\u03b3(i.e., minimizing the right-hand side) from Theorem 3.1, but this results in a non-intuitive cubic dependence on\\n\\u03c1. In practice, the strategy of decreasing \\u03b3until convergence is achieved, but not further, yields reasonable results.\\nFurthermore, we want to point out that the condition \\u03c1 <1\\nLis precisely the best possible bound for EG+.\\n3.1 Improved bounds under monotonicity\\nWhile the above theorem also holds if the operator Fis monotone, we can modify the proof slightly to obtain a better dependence on\\nthe parameters:\\nTheorem 3.2.

However, we\\nwant to compare the above bound to more similar results on rates for the best iterate in terms of the operator norm. The same rate as\\nours for OGDA is shown, but requires the conservative step size bound a\\u22641\\n16L. This was later improved to a\\u22641\\n3L. All of these\\nonly deal with the case \\u03b3= 1. The only other reference that deals with a generalized (i.e., not necessarily \\u03b3= 1) version of OGDA\\nis another work, where the resulting step size condition is a\\u22642\\u2212\\u03b3\\n4L, which is strictly worse than ours for any \\u03b3. To summarize, not\\nonly do we show for the first time that the step size of a generalization of OGDA can go above1\\n2L, but we also provide the least\\nrestrictive bound for any value of \\u03b3.\\n3.2 OGDA+ stochastic\\nIn this section, we discuss the setting where, instead of the exact operator F, we only have access to a collection of independent\\nestimators F(\\u00b7, \\u03bei)at every iteration. We assume here that the estimator Fis unbiased, i.e., E[F(uk, \\u03be)|uk\\u22121] =F(uk), and has\\nbounded variance E[\\u2225F(uk, \\u03be)\\u2212F(uk)\\u22252]\\u2264\\u03c32. We show that we can still guarantee convergence by using batch sizes Bof order\\nO(\\u03f5\\u22121).\\nAlgorithm 2 stochastic OGDA+\\nRequire: Starting point u0=u\\u22121\\u2208Rd, step size a >0, parameter 0< \\u03b3\\u22641and batch size B.\\nfork= 0,1, ...do\\nSample i.i.d.

LetF:Rd\\u2192RdbeL-Lipschitz satisfying Assumption 1 with1\\nL> \\u03c1, and let (uk)k\\u22650be the sequence of\\niterates generated by stochastic OGDA+, with aand\\u03b3satisfying \\u03c1 < a <1\\u2212\\u03b3\\n1+\\u03b31\\nL. Then, to visit an \\u03f5-stationary point such that\\nmini=0,...,k\\u22121E[\\u2225F(ui)\\u22252]< \\u03f5, we require\\n1\\nka\\u03b3(a\\u2212\\u03c1)\\u2225u0+a\\u02dcg0\\u2212u\\u2217\\u22252max\\u001a\\n1,4\\u03c32\\naL\\u03f5\\u001b\\ncalls to the stochastic oracle \\u02dcF, with large batch sizes of order O(\\u03f5\\u22121).\\nIn practice, large batch sizes of order O(\\u03f5\\u22121)are typically not desirable; instead, a small or decreasing step size is preferred. In the\\nweak Minty setting, this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence. Unfortunately,\\nthe current analysis does not allow for variable \\u03b3.\\n4 EG+ with adaptive step sizes\\nIn this section, we present Algorithm 3, which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the\\nLipschitz constant L, as it is typically difficult to compute in practice. Additionally, it is well known that rough estimates will lead to\\nsmall step sizes and slow convergence behavior. However, in the presence of weak Minty solutions, there is additional interest in\\nchoosing large step sizes. We observed in Theorem 3.1 and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that the\\nstep size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak Minty parameter \\u03c1to guarantee convergence at all. For these reasons, we want\\nto outline a method using adaptive step sizes, meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no line-search is carried\\nout.\\nSince the analysis of OGDA+ is already quite involved in the constant step size regime, we choose to equip EG+ with an adaptive\\nstep size which estimates the inverse of the (local) Lipschitz constant, see (4). Due to the fact that the literature on adaptive methods,\\nespecially in the context of VIs, is so vast, we do not aim to give a comprehensive review but highlight only a few with especially\\ninteresting properties. In particular, we do not want to touch on methods with a linesearch procedure, which typically result in\\nmultiple gradient computations per iteration.\\nWe use a simple and therefore widely used step size choice that naively estimates the local Lipschitz constant and forces a monotone\\ndecreasing behavior. Such step sizes have been used extensively for monotone VIs and similarly in the context of the mirror-prox\\nmethod, which corresponds to EG in the setting of (non-Euclidean) Bregman distances.\\nA version of EG with a different adaptive step size choice has been investigated, with the unique feature that it is able to achieve the\\noptimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems without modification. However, these rates are only for monotone VIs and\\nare in terms of the gap function.\\nOne of the drawbacks of adaptive methods resides in the fact that the step sizes are typically required to be nonincreasing, which\\nresults in poor behavior if a high-curvature area was visited by the iterates before reaching a low-curvature region. To the best of our\\nknowledge, the only method that is allowed to use nonmonotone step sizes to treat VIs and does not use a possibly costly linesearch\\nis the golden ratio algorithm. It comes with the additional benefit of not requiring a global bound on the Lipschitz constant of Fat\\nall. While it is known that this method converges under the stronger assumption of the existence of Minty solutions, a quantitative\\nconvergence result is still open.\\nAlgorithm 3 EG+ with adaptive step size\\nRequire: Starting points u0,\\u00afu0\\u2208Rd, initial step size a0and parameters \\u03c4\\u2208(0,1)and0< \\u03b3\\u22641.\\nfork= 0,1, ...do\\nFind the step size:\\nak= min\\u001a\\nak\\u22121,\\u03c4\\u2225\\u00afuk\\u2212\\u00afuk\\u22121\\u2225\\n\\u2225F(\\u00afuk)\\u2212F(\\u00afuk\\u22121)\\u2225\\u001b\\n(4)\\nCompute next iterate:\\nuk= \\u00afuk\\u2212akF(\\u00afuk)\\n\\u00afuk+1= \\u00afuk\\u2212ak\\u03b3F(uk).\\nend for\\nClearly, akis monotonically decreasing by construction. Moreover, it is bounded away from zero by the simple observation that\\nak\\u2265min{a0, \\u03c4/L}>0. The sequence therefore converges to a positive number, which we denote by a\\u221e:= lim kak.\\nTheorem 4.1. LetF:Rd\\u2192RdbeL-Lipschitz that satisfies Assumption 1, where u\\u2217denotes any weak Minty solution, with\\na\\u221e>2\\u03c1, and let (uk)k\\u22650be the iterates generated by Algorithm 3 with \\u03b3=1\\n2and\\u03c4\\u2208(0,1).

The main advantage resides in the fact that the\\nLipschitz constant of the operator Fdoes not need to be known. Moreover, the step size choice presented in (4) might allow us\\nto take steps much larger than what would be suggested by a global Lipschitz constant if the iterates never, or only during later\\niterations, visit the region of high curvature (large local L). In such cases, these larger step sizes come with the additional advantage\\nthat they allow us to solve a richer class of problems, as we are able to relax the condition \\u03c1 <1\\n4Lin the case of EG+ to \\u03c1 < a \\u221e/2,\\nwhere a\\u221e= lim kak\\u2265\\u03c4/L.\\nOn the other hand, we face the problem that the bounds in Theorem 4.1 only hold after an unknown number of initial iterations when\\nak/ak+1\\u22641\\n\\u03c4is finally satisfied. In theory, this might take a long time if the curvature around the solution is much higher than in\\nthe starting area, as this will force the need to decrease the step size very late into the solution process, resulting in the quotient\\nak/ak+1being too large. This drawback could be mitigated by choosing \\u03c4smaller. However, this will result in poor performance\\ndue to small step sizes. Even for monotone problems where this type of step size has been proposed, this problem could not be\\ncircumvented, and authors instead focused on the convergence of the iterates without any rate.\\n5 Numerical experiments\\nIn the following, we compare the EG+ method with the two methods we propose: OGDA+ and EG+ with adaptive step size (see\\nAlgorithm 1 and Algorithm 3, respectively). Last but not least, we also include the CurvatureEG+ method, which is a modification\\nof EG+ that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps. In addition, a backtracking linesearch is performed with\\nan initial guess made by second-order information, whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments.\\n5.1 Von Neumann\\u2019s ratio game\\nWe consider von Neumann\\u2019s ratio game, which is given by:\\nmin\\nx\\u2208\\u2206mmax\\ny\\u2208\\u2206nV(x, y) =\\u27e8x, Ry\\u27e9\\n\\u27e8x, Sy\\u27e9, (5)\\nwhere R\\u2208Rm\\u00d7nandS\\u2208Rm\\u00d7nwith\\u27e8x, Sy\\u27e9>0for all x\\u2208\\u2206m, y\\u2208\\u2206n, with \\u2206 :={z\\u2208Rd:zi>0,Pd\\ni=1zi= 1}denoting\\nthe unit simplex. Expression (5) can be interpreted as the value V(x, y)for a stochastic game with a single state and mixed strategies.\\nWe see an illustration of a particularly difficult instance of (5). Interestingly, we still observe good convergence behavior, although\\nan estimated \\u03c1is more than ten times larger than the estimated Lipschitz constant.\\n5.2 Forsaken\\nA particularly difficult min-max toy example with a \\\"Forsaken\\\" solution was proposed and is given by:\\nmin\\nx\\u2208Rmax\\ny\\u2208Rx(y\\u22120.45) + \\u03d5(x)\\u2212\\u03d5(y), (6)\\nwhere \\u03d5(z) =1\\n6z6\\u22122\\n4z4+1\\n4z2\\u22121\\n2z. This problem exhibits a Stampacchia solution at (x\\u2217, y\\u2217)\\u2248(0.08,0.4), but also two limit\\ncycles not containing any critical point of the objective function. In addition, it was also observed that the limit cycle closer to\\nthe solution repels possible trajectories of iterates, thus \\\"shielding\\\" the solution. Later, it was noticed that, restricted to the box\\n\\u2225(x, y)\\u2225\\u221e<3, the above-mentioned solution is weak Minty with \\u03c1\\u22652\\u00b70.477761 , which is much larger than1\\n2L\\u22480.08. In line\\nwith these observations, we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by1\\nLconverge. In light of this\\nobservation, a backtracking linesearch was proposed, which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global Lipschitz\\nconstant. Similarly, our proposed adaptive step size version of EG+ (see Algorithm 3) is also able to break through the repelling\\nlimit cycle and converge to the solution. On top of this, it does so at a faster rate and without the need for additional computations in\\nthe backtracking procedure.\\n5.3 Lower bound example\\nThe following min-max problem was introduced as a lower bound on the dependence between \\u03c1andLfor EG+:\\nmin\\nx\\u2208Rmax\\ny\\u2208R\\u00b5xy+\\u03b6\\n2(x2\\u2212y2). (7)\\nIn particular, it was stated that EG+ (with any \\u03b3) and constant step size a=1\\nLconverges for this problem if and only if (0,0)is a\\nweak Minty solution with \\u03c1 <1\\u2212\\u03b3\\nL, where \\u03c1andLcan be computed explicitly in the above example and are given by:\\nL=p\\n\\u00b52+\\u03b62and \\u03c1=\\u00b52\\u2212\\u03b62\\n2\\u00b5.\\nBy choosing \\u00b5= 3and\\u03b6=\\u22121, we get exactly \\u03c1=1\\nL, therefore predicting divergence of EG+ for any \\u03b3, which is exactly what is\\nempirically observed. Although the general upper bound proved in Theorem 3.1 only states convergence in the case \\u03c1 <1\\nL, we\\nobserve rapid convergence of OGDA+ for this example, showcasing that it can drastically outperform EG+ in some scenarios.\\n66 Conclusion\\nMany intriguing questions persist in the domain of min-max problems, particularly when departing from the convex-concave\\nframework. Very recently, it was demonstrated that the O(1/k)bounds on the squared operator norm for EG and OGDA for the\\nlast iterate (and not just the best one) are valid even in the negatively comonotone setting. Deriving a comparable statement in the\\npresence of merely weak Minty solutions remains an open question.\\nIn general, our analysis and experiments seem to suggest that there is minimal benefit in employing OGDA+ over EG+ for the\\nmajority of problems, as the reduced iteration cost is counterbalanced by the smaller step size. An exception is presented by problem\\n(7), which is not covered by theory, and OGDA+ is the only method capable of converging.\\nFinally, we note that the previous paradigm in pure minimization of \\\"smaller step size ensures convergence\\\" but \\\"larger step size\\ngets there faster,\\\" where the latter is typically constrained by the reciprocal of the gradient\\u2019s Lipschitz constant, does not appear\\nto hold true for min-max problems anymore. The analysis of various methods in the presence of weak Minty solutions indicates\\nthat convergence can be lost if the step size is excessively small and sometimes needs to be larger than1\\nL, which one can typically\\nonly hope for in adaptive methods. Our EG+ method with adaptive step size accomplishes this even without the added expense of a\\nbacktracking linesearch.article graphicx\\n7\",\n          \"Synergistic Convergence of Photosynthetic Pathways\\nin Subterranean Fungal Networks\\nAbstract\\nThe perpetual oscillations of quantum fluctuations in the cosmos have been found\\nto intersect with the nuanced intricacies of botanical hieroglyphics, thereby influ-\\nencing the ephemeral dance of photons on the surface of chloroplasts, which in\\nturn modulates the synergetic harmonization of carboxylation and oxygenation pro-\\ncesses, while concurrently precipitating an existential inquiry into the paradigmatic\\nunderpinnings of floricultural axioms, and paradoxically giving rise to an unfore-\\nseen convergence of gastronomical and photosynthetic ontologies.

The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limited\\ncollaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantly\\nhindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles by\\nintroducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetrically\\naccurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal-\\nibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levels\\nof complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). A\\ntotal of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologies\\ndeveloped during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in\\n3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation in\\ndietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshop\\nchallenge and the dataset is accessible via the provided URL.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe convergence of computer vision technologies with culinary practices has pioneered innovative\\napproaches to dietary monitoring and nutritional assessment. The MetaFood Workshop Challenge\\nrepresents a landmark initiative in this emerging field, responding to the pressing demand for precise\\nand scalable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. Such\\ntechnologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked to\\ndiet.\\nBy concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual\\ninputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the\\ndisparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique\\nsolutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also\\nmeeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer\\nvision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward.\\nThese advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food\\nportion estimation across diverse applications, from individual health tracking to extensive nutritional\\ninvestigations.\\nConventional methods for assessing diet, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires\\n(FFQs), are frequently reliant on manual data entry, which is prone to inaccuracies and can be\\nburdensome. The lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images further complicates the use of regression-\\nbased methods for estimating food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By enhancing\\n3D reconstruction for food, the aim is to provide more accurate and intuitive nutritional assessment\\ntools. This technology could revolutionize the sharing of culinary experiences and significantly\\nimpact nutrition science and public health.\\nParticipants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 distinct food items from 2D images, mim-\\nicking scenarios where mobile devices equipped with depth-sensing cameras are used for dietary\\n.recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based\\non the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single\\ntop-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of\\nproposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use\\nof a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame,\\nensuring the 3D models maintained accurate real-world measurements for portion size estimation.\\nThis initiative not only expands the frontiers of 3D reconstruction technology but also sets the stage\\nfor more reliable and user-friendly real-world applications, including image-based dietary assessment.\\nThe resulting solutions hold the potential to profoundly influence nutritional intake monitoring and\\ncomprehension, supporting broader health and wellness objectives. As progress continues, innovative\\napplications are anticipated to transform personal health management, nutritional research, and the\\nwider food industry. The remainder of this report is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into the\\nexisting literature on food portion size estimation, Section 3 describes the dataset and evaluation\\nframework used in the challenge, and Sections 4, 5, and 6 discuss the methodologies and findings of\\nthe top three teams (V olETA, ININ-VIAUN, and FoodRiddle), respectively.\\n2 Related Work\\nEstimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, aiming to determine the\\nvolume, energy content, or macronutrients directly from images of meals. Unlike the well-studied\\ntask of food recognition, estimating food portions is particularly challenging due to the lack of 3D\\ninformation and physical size references necessary for accurately judging the actual size of food\\nportions. Accurate portion size estimation requires understanding the volume and density of food,\\nelements that are hard to deduce from a 2D image, underscoring the need for sophisticated techniques\\nto tackle this problem. Current methods for estimating food portions are grouped into four categories.\\nStereo-Based Approaches use multiple images to reconstruct the 3D structure of food. Some methods\\nestimate food volume using multi-view stereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while\\nothers perform two-view dense reconstruction. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has\\nalso been used for continuous, real-time food volume estimation. However, these methods are limited\\nby their need for multiple images, which is not always practical.\\nModel-Based Approaches use predefined shapes and templates to estimate volume. For instance,\\ncertain templates are assigned to foods from a library and transformed based on physical references to\\nestimate the size and location of the food. Template matching approaches estimate food volume from\\na single image, but they struggle with variations in food shapes that differ from predefined templates.\\nRecent work has used 3D food meshes as templates to align camera and object poses for portion size\\nestimation.\\nDepth Camera-Based Approaches use depth cameras to create depth maps, capturing the distance from\\nthe camera to the food. These depth maps form a voxel representation used for volume estimation.\\nThe main drawback is the need for high-quality depth maps and the extra processing required for\\nconsumer-grade depth sensors.\\nDeep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion\\nestimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an\\n\\\"Energy Distribution Map\\\" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both\\nimages and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning\\nmethods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance\\ndegrading when test images significantly differ from training data.\\nWhile these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their\\nwidespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based\\napproaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware,\\nand deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D\\nreconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting\\nto various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results,\\nand enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the\\norganization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and\\n2develop more accurate, user-friendly, and widely applicable food portion estimation techniques,\\nimpacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.\\n3 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline\\n3.1 Dataset Description\\nThe dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D\\ndataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy\\nin the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern\\nmat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,\\ndetermined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:\\n\\u2022 Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.\\n\\u2022 Medium: 30 images.\\n\\u2022 Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.\\nTable 1 details the food items included in the dataset.\\nTable 1: MetaFood Challenge Data Details\\nObject Index Food Item Difficulty Level Number of Frames\\n1 Strawberry Easy 199\\n2 Cinnamon bun Easy 200\\n3 Pork rib Easy 200\\n4 Corn Easy 200\\n5 French toast Easy 200\\n6 Sandwich Easy 200\\n7 Burger Easy 200\\n8 Cake Easy 200\\n9 Blueberry muffin Medium 30\\n10 Banana Medium 30\\n11 Salmon Medium 30\\n12 Steak Medium 30\\n13 Burrito Medium 30\\n14 Hotdog Medium 30\\n15 Chicken nugget Medium 30\\n16 Everything bagel Hard 1\\n17 Croissant Hard 1\\n18 Shrimp Hard 1\\n19 Waffle Hard 1\\n20 Pizza Hard 1\\n3.2 Evaluation Pipeline\\nThe evaluation process is split into two phases, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D\\nmodels in terms of shape (3D structure) and portion size (volume).\\n3.2.1 Phase-I: Volume Accuracy\\nIn the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used to evaluate portion size\\naccuracy, calculated as follows:\\nMAPE =1\\nnnX\\ni=1\\f\\f\\f\\fAi\\u2212Fi\\nAi\\f\\f\\f\\f\\u00d7100% (1)\\n3where Aiis the actual volume (in ml) of the i-th food item obtained from the scanned 3D food mesh,\\nandFiis the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh.\\n3.2.2 Phase-II: Shape Accuracy\\nTeams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to submit complete 3D mesh files for each food item.\\nThis phase involves several steps to ensure precision and fairness:\\n\\u2022Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final Phase-I submissions for\\nconsistency, and visual inspections are conducted to prevent rule violations.\\n\\u2022Model Alignment: Participants receive ground truth 3D models and a script to compute the\\nfinal Chamfer distance. They must align their models with the ground truth and prepare a\\ntransformation matrix for each submitted object. The final Chamfer distance is calculated\\nusing these models and matrices.\\n\\u2022Chamfer Distance Calculation: Shape accuracy is assessed using the Chamfer distance\\nmetric. Given two point sets XandY, the Chamfer distance is defined as:\\ndCD(X, Y ) =1\\n|X|X\\nx\\u2208Xmin\\ny\\u2208Y\\u2225x\\u2212y\\u22252\\n2+1\\n|Y|X\\ny\\u2208Ymin\\nx\\u2208X\\u2225x\\u2212y\\u22252\\n2 (2)\\nThis metric offers a comprehensive measure of similarity between the reconstructed 3D models and\\nthe ground truth. The final ranking is determined by combining scores from both Phase-I (volume\\naccuracy) and Phase-II (shape accuracy). Note that after the Phase-I evaluation, quality issues were\\nfound with the data for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget), so these items were excluded\\nfrom the final overall evaluation.\\n4 First Place Team - VolETA\\n4.1 Methodology\\nThe team\\u2019s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and calculate\\nprecise food volumes.\\n4.1.1 Overview\\nThe team\\u2019s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume\\nfrom RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection ensures data quality, supported by perceptual\\nhashing and blur detection. Camera pose estimation and object segmentation pave the way for neural\\nsurface reconstruction, creating detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement steps, including\\nisolated piece removal and scaling factor adjustments, enhance accuracy. This approach provides a\\nthorough solution for accurate food volume assessment, with potential uses in nutrition analysis.\\n4.1.2 The Team\\u2019s Proposal: VolETA\\nThe team starts by acquiring input data, specifically RGBD images and corresponding food object\\nmasks. The RGBD images, denoted as ID={IDi}n\\ni=1, where nis the total number of frames,\\nprovide depth information alongside RGB images. The food object masks, {Mf\\ni}n\\ni=1, help identify\\nregions of interest within these images.\\nNext, the team selects keyframes. From the set {IDi}n\\ni=1, keyframes {IK\\nj}k\\nj=1\\u2286 {IDi}n\\ni=1are\\nchosen. A method is implemented to detect and remove duplicate and blurry images, ensuring\\nhigh-quality frames. This involves applying a Gaussian blurring kernel followed by the fast Fourier\\ntransform method. Near-Image Similarity uses perceptual hashing and Hamming distance threshold-\\ning to detect similar images and retain overlapping ones. Duplicates and blurry images are excluded\\nto maintain data integrity and accuracy.\\nUsing the selected keyframes {IK\\nj}k\\nj=1, the team estimates camera poses through a method called\\nPixSfM, which involves extracting features using SuperPoint, matching them with SuperGlue, and\\nrefining them. The outputs are the camera poses {Cj}k\\nj=1, crucial for understanding the scene\\u2019s\\nspatial layout.\\n4In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segments\\nthe reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask MRfor each\\nkeyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ method\\nextends the reference object mask MRto all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference object\\nmasks {MR\\ni}n\\ni=1. This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.\\nTo create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {MR\\ni}n\\ni=1, and\\nfood object masks {MF\\ni}n\\ni=1. This step, denoted as {IR\\ni}n\\ni=1, integrates various data sources into a\\nunified format for further processing.\\nThe team converts the RGBA images {IR\\ni}n\\ni=1and camera poses {Cj}k\\nj=1into meaningful metadata\\nand modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.\\nThe modeled data Dmis input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes\\n{Rf, Rr}for the reference and food objects, providing detailed 3D representations. The team uses the\\n\\\"Remove Isolated Pieces\\\" technique to refine the meshes. Given that the scenes contain only one food\\nitem, the diameter threshold is set to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes isolated connected\\ncomponents with diameters less than or equal to 5%, resulting in a cleaned mesh {RCf, RCr}. This\\nstep ensures that only significant parts of the mesh are retained.\\nThe team manually identifies an initial scaling factor Susing the reference mesh via MeshLab. This\\nfactor is fine-tuned to Sfusing depth information and food and reference masks, ensuring accurate\\nscaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the fine-tuned scaling factor Sfis applied to the\\ncleaned food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled food mesh RFf. This step culminates in an\\naccurately scaled 3D representation of the food object, enabling precise volume estimation.\\n4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factor\\nGenerally, 3D reconstruction methods produce unitless meshes by default. To address this, the team\\nmanually determines the scaling factor by measuring the distance for each block of the reference\\nobject mesh. The average of all block lengths lavgis calculated, while the actual real-world length is\\nconstant at lreal= 0.012meters. The scaling factor S=lreal/lavgis applied to the clean food mesh\\nRCf, resulting in the final scaled food mesh RFfin meters.\\nThe team uses depth information along with food and reference object masks to validate the scaling\\nfactors. The method for assessing food size involves using overhead RGB images for each scene.\\nInitially, the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) is determined using the reference object. Subse-\\nquently, the food width ( fw) and length ( fl) are extracted using a food object mask. To determine the\\nfood height ( fh), a two-step process is followed. First, binary image segmentation is performed using\\nthe overhead depth and reference images, yielding a segmented depth image for the reference object.\\nThe average depth is then calculated using the segmented reference object depth ( dr). Similarly,\\nemploying binary image segmentation with an overhead food object mask and depth image, the\\naverage depth for the segmented food depth image ( df) is computed. The estimated food height fhis\\nthe absolute difference between dranddf. To assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the food\\nbounding box volume (fw\\u00d7fl\\u00d7fh)\\u00d7PPU is computed. The team evaluates if the scaling factor\\nSgenerates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine. Table 2 lists the scaling\\nfactors, PPU, 2D reference object dimensions, 3D food object dimensions, and potential volume.\\nFor one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team uses One-2-3-45 to reconstruct a 3D model from a single\\nRGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation to both food RGB and mask images.\\nIsolated pieces are removed from the generated mesh, and the scaling factor S, which is closer to the\\npotential volume of the clean mesh, is reused.\\n4.2 Experimental Results\\n4.2.1 Implementation settings\\nExperiments were conducted using two GPUs: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/12G and RTX 3060/6G.

The\\nteam adheres to a method involving corner projection matching. Specifically, utilizing the COLMAP\\ndense model, the team acquires the pose of each image along with dense point cloud data. For any\\ngiven image imgkand its extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the team initially performs threshold-based\\ncorner detection, setting the threshold at 240. This step allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates\\nof all detected corners. Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters kand the extrinsic parameters\\n[R|t]k, the point cloud is projected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of the\\ncorners, the team can identify the closest point coordinates Pk\\nifor each corner, where irepresents the\\nindex of the corner. Thus, they can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows:\\nDk\\nij= (Pk\\ni\\u2212Pk\\nj)2\\u2200i\\u0338=j (3)\\nTo determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image k, the team takes the\\nminimum value of each row of the matrix Dk(excluding the diagonal) to form the vector dk. The\\nmedian of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by Equation 4, where\\n0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm):\\nscale =0.012Pn\\ni=1med(dk)(4)\\n75.1.2 3D Reconstruction\\nThe 3D reconstruction process, depicted in Figure 10, involves two different pipelines to accommodate\\nvariations in input viewpoints. The first fifteen objects are processed using one pipeline, while the\\nlast five single-view objects are processed using another.\\nFor the initial fifteen objects, the team uses COLMAP to estimate poses and segment the food using\\nthe provided segment masks. Advanced multi-view 3D reconstruction methods are then applied to\\nreconstruct the segmented food. The team employs three different reconstruction methods: COLMAP,\\nDiffusioNeRF, and NeRF2Mesh. They select the best reconstruction results from these methods and\\nextract the mesh. The extracted mesh is scaled using the estimated scale factor, and optimization\\ntechniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh.\\nFor the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction\\nmethods, including Zero123, Zero123++, One2345, ZeroNVS, and DreamGaussian. They choose\\nZeroNVS to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution of the input image. The\\nintrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object are used, and an optimization method based\\non reprojection error refines the extrinsic parameters of the single camera. Due to limitations in\\nsingle-view reconstruction, depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular\\nimage are used to determine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, optimization techniques are\\napplied to obtain a refined mesh.\\n5.1.3 Mesh refinement\\nDuring the 3D Reconstruction phase, it was observed that the model\\u2019s results often suffered from low\\nquality due to holes on the object\\u2019s surface and substantial noise, as shown in Figure 11.\\nTo address the holes, MeshFix, an optimization method based on computational geometry, is em-\\nployed. For surface noise, Laplacian Smoothing is used for mesh smoothing operations. The\\nLaplacian Smoothing method adjusts the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring\\nvertices:\\nV(new)\\ni =V(old)\\ni+\\u03bb\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed1\\n|N(i)|X\\nj\\u2208N(i)V(old)\\nj\\u2212V(old)\\ni\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8 (5)\\nIn their implementation, the smoothing factor \\u03bbis set to 0.2, and 10 iterations are performed.\\n5.2 Experimental Results\\n5.2.1 Estimated scale factor\\nThe scale factors estimated using the described method are shown in Table 5. Each image and the\\ncorresponding reconstructed 3D model yield a scale factor, and the table presents the average scale\\nfactor for each object.\\n5.2.2 Reconstructed meshes\\nThe refined meshes obtained using the described methods are shown in Figure 12. The predicted\\nmodel volumes, ground truth model volumes, and the percentage errors between them are presented\\nin Table 6.\\n5.2.3 Alignment\\nThe team designs a multi-stage alignment method for evaluating reconstruction quality. Figure 13\\nillustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the central points of both the predicted and\\nground truth models are calculated, and the predicted model is moved to align with the central point\\nof the ground truth model. Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly\\nreducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain\\nthe final transformation matrix.\\nThe total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.\\n8Table 5: Estimated Scale Factors\\nObject Index Food Item Scale Factor\\n1 Strawberry 0.060058\\n2 Cinnamon bun 0.081829\\n3 Pork rib 0.073861\\n4 Corn 0.083594\\n5 French toast 0.078632\\n6 Sandwich 0.088368\\n7 Burger 0.103124\\n8 Cake 0.068496\\n9 Blueberry muffin 0.059292\\n10 Banana 0.058236\\n11 Salmon 0.083821\\n13 Burrito 0.069663\\n14 Hotdog 0.073766\\nTable 6: Metric of V olume\\nObject Index Predicted V olume Ground Truth Error Percentage\\n1 44.51 38.53 15.52\\n2 321.26 280.36 14.59\\n3 336.11 249.67 34.62\\n4 347.54 295.13 17.76\\n5 389.28 392.58 0.84\\n6 197.82 218.44 9.44\\n7 412.52 368.77 11.86\\n8 181.21 173.13 4.67\\n9 233.79 232.74 0.45\\n10 160.06 163.09 1.86\\n11 86.0 85.18 0.96\\n13 334.7 308.28 8.57\\n14 517.75 589.83 12.22\\n16 176.24 262.15 32.77\\n17 180.68 181.36 0.37\\n18 13.58 20.58 34.01\\n19 117.72 108.35 8.64\\n20 117.43 119.83 20.03\\n6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle\\n6.1 Methodology\\nTo achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as\\ndepicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from-\\nmotion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently,\\na sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh\\nquality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to\\nfacilitate model generation.\\n6.1.1 Multi-View Reconstruction\\nFor Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integrating\\nSuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limited\\nkeypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15.\\nIn the mesh reconstruction phase, the team\\u2019s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, which\\nemploys a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion\\n9and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized to\\nproduce a dense point cloud.\\nDuring post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outline\\nof the supporting surface, and projected the lower mesh vertices onto this surface. They utilized\\nthe reconstructed checkerboard to correct the model\\u2019s scale and employed Poisson reconstruction to\\ncreate a complete, watertight mesh of the subject.\\n6.1.2 Single-View Reconstruction\\nFor 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team utilized advanced methods such as LGM, Instant\\nMesh, and One-2-3-45 to generate an initial mesh. This initial mesh was then refined in conjunction\\nwith depth structure information.\\nTo adjust the scale, the team estimated the object\\u2019s length using the checkerboard as a reference,\\nassuming that the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D\\nobject back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object.\\n6.2 Experimental Results\\nThrough a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that\\nminimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization\\naimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion\\nof this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects\\namounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for\\nboth multi- view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.\\nTable 7: Total Errors for Different Teams on Multi-view and Single-view Data\\nTeam Multi-view (1-14) Single-view (16-20)\\nFoodRiddle 0.036362 0.019232\\nININ-VIAUN 0.041552 0.027889\\nV olETA 0.071921 0.058726\\n7 Conclusion\\nThis report examines and compiles the techniques and findings from the MetaFood Workshop\\nchallenge on 3D Food Reconstruction. The challenge sought to enhance 3D reconstruction methods\\nby concentrating on food items, tackling the distinct difficulties presented by varied textures, reflective\\nsurfaces, and intricate geometries common in culinary subjects.\\nThe competition involved 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with differing\\nnumbers of input images, specifically designed to challenge participants in creating robust reconstruc-\\ntion models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy\\nthrough Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance\\nmetric.\\nOf all participating teams, three reached the final submission stage, presenting a range of innovative\\nsolutions. Team V olETA secured first place with the best overall performance in both Phase-I and\\nPhase-II, followed by team ININ-VIAUN in second place. Additionally, the FoodRiddle team\\nexhibited superior performance in Phase-II, highlighting a competitive and high-caliber field of\\nentries for 3D mesh reconstruction. The challenge has successfully advanced the field of 3D food\\nreconstruction, demonstrating the potential for accurate volume estimation and shape reconstruction\\nin nutritional analysis and food presentation applications. The novel methods developed by the\\nparticipating teams establish a strong foundation for future research in this area, potentially leading\\nto more precise and user-friendly approaches for dietary assessment and monitoring.\\n10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This concept, which has only recently been defined, has\\nalready demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time.\\nWe establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method (OGDA) within\\nthis framework, achieving a convergence rate of 1/k for the most effective iteration, measured by the squared\\noperator norm, a result that aligns with the extragradient method (EG). Furthermore, we introduce a modified\\nversion of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problem\\u2019s\\nspecific parameters.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems,\\nhave generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks,\\nadversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developed\\nthat generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization\\ncomponent and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability in\\ncertain cases.\\nA specific subset of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was analyzed, and it was found that the extragradient method (EG)\\nexhibited favorable convergence behavior in experimental settings. Surprisingly, these problems did not appear to possess any of\\nthe recognized favorable characteristics, such as monotonicity or Minty solutions. Subsequently, a suitable concept was identified\\n(see Assumption 1), which is less restrictive than the presence of a Minty solution (a condition frequently employed in the existing\\nliterature) and also extends the idea of negative comonotonicity. Because of these properties that unify and generalize, the concept of\\nweak Minty solutions was quickly investigated.\\nAssumption 1 (Weak Minty solution). For a given operator F:Rd\\u2192Rd, there is a point u\\u2217\\u2208Rdand a parameter \\u03c1 >0such that:\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u2265 \\u2212\\u03c1\\n2\\u2225F(u)\\u22252\\u2200u\\u2208Rd. (1)\\nMoreover, it has been demonstrated that a modified version of EG is capable of addressing problems with such solutions, achieving\\na complexity of O(\\u03f5\\u22121)for the squared operator norm. This adaptation, referred to as EG+, is based on a bold extrapolation step\\nfollowed by a cautious update step. A similar step size approach has been previously examined in the context of a stochastic variant\\nof EG.\\nIn a similar vein, we explore a variation of the optimistic gradient descent ascent (OGDA), also known as Forward-Reflected-\\nBackward (FoRB). We address the following question with an affirmative answer:\\nCan OGDA achieve convergence guarantees comparable to those of EG when dealing with weak Minty solutions?\\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that a modified version of the OGDA method, defined for a step size a >0and a parameter 0< \\u03b3\\u22641\\nas follows:\\nuk= \\u00afuk\\u2212aF(\\u00afuk),\\n\\u00afuk+1= \\u00afuk\\u2212\\u03b3aF(uk),\\u2200k\\u22650,\\ncan achieve the same convergence bounds as EG+ by requiring only a single gradient oracle call in each iteration.\\nIt is worth noting that OGDA is most frequently expressed in a form where \\u03b3= 1. However, two recent studies have examined\\na more generalized coefficient. While these earlier studies focused on the monotone setting, the true significance of \\u03b3becomesapparent only when dealing with weak Minty solutions. In this context, we find that \\u03b3must be greater than 1 to ensure convergence,\\na phenomenon that is not observed in monotone problems.\\nWhen examining a general smooth min-max problem:\\nmin\\nxmax\\nyf(x, y)\\nthe operator Fmentioned in Assumption 1 naturally emerges as F(u) := [\\u2207xf(x, y),\\u2212\\u2207yf(x, y)]withu= (x, y). However,\\nby examining saddle point problems from the broader viewpoint of variational inequalities (VIs) through the operator F, we can\\nconcurrently address more scenarios, such as certain equilibrium problems.\\nThe parameter \\u03c1in the definition of weak Minty solutions (1) is crucial for both the analysis and the experiments. Specifically, it\\nis essential that the step size exceeds a value proportional to \\u03c1. Simultaneously, as is typical, the step size is limited from above\\nby the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of F. For instance, since some researchers require the step size to be less than1\\n4L, their\\nconvergence claim is valid only if \\u03c1 <1\\n4L. This condition was later improved to \\u03c1 <1\\n2Lfor the choice \\u03b3= 1and to \\u03c1 <1\\nLfor\\neven smaller values of \\u03b3. As in the monotone setting, OGDA requires a smaller step size than EG. Nevertheless, through a different\\nanalysis, we are able to match the most general condition on the weak Minty parameter \\u03c1 <1\\nLfor appropriate \\u03b3anda.\\n1.1 Contribution\\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\\n1.We establish a new convergence rate of O(1/k), measured by the squared operator norm, for a modified version of OGDA,\\nwhich we call OGDA+. This rate matches that of EG and builds upon the recently introduced concept of weak solutions to\\nthe Minty variational inequality.\\n2.Even when a stronger condition is imposed, specifically that the operator is also monotone, we enhance the range of feasible\\nstep sizes for OGDA+ and obtain the most favorable result known for the standard method ( \\u03b3= 1).\\n3. We demonstrate a complexity bound of O(\\u03f5\\u22122)for a stochastic variant of the OGDA+ method.\\n4.We also introduce an adaptive step size version of EG+. This version achieves the same convergence guarantees without\\nrequiring any knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the operator F. Consequently, it can potentially take larger steps in\\nareas with low curvature, enabling convergence where a fixed step size strategy might fail.\\n1.2 Related literature\\nWe will concentrate on the nonconvex-nonconcave setting, as there is a substantial body of work on convergence rates in terms of a gap\\nfunction or distance to a solution for monotone problems, as well as generalizations such as nonconvex-concave, convex-nonconcave,\\nor under the Polyak-\\u0141ojasiewicz assumption.\\nWeak Minty. It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution,\\ntermed \\\"weak Minty,\\\" without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions.\\nConvergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as\\nthe update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the\\nlength of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search is\\nalso proposed, which may incur extra gradient computations or require second-order information (in contrast to the adaptive step\\nsize we propose in Algorithm 3). A different approach is taken by focusing on the min-max setting and using multiple ascent steps\\nper descent step, achieving the same O(1/k)rate as EG.\\nMinty solutions. Numerous studies have presented various methods for scenarios where the problem at hand has a Minty solution.\\nIt was shown that weakly monotone VIs can be solved by iteratively adding a quadratic proximity term and repeatedly optimizing\\nthe resulting strongly monotone VI using any convergent method. The convergence of the OGDA method was proven, but without a\\nspecific rate. It was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm (GRAAL) is valid without any changes. While\\nthe assumption that a Minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting, it is challenging to find non-monotone\\nproblems that possess such solutions. In our setting, as per Assumption 1, the Minty inequality (MVI) can be violated at any point\\nby a factor proportional to the squared operator norm.\\nNegative comonotonicity. Although previously studied under the term \\\"cohypomonotonicity,\\\" the concept of negative comono-\\ntonicity has recently been explored. It offers a generalization of monotonicity, but in a direction distinct from the concept of Minty\\nsolutions, and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context. An anchored version of EG was studied, and\\nan improved convergence rate of O(1/k2)(in terms of the squared operator norm) was shown. Similarly, an accelerated version of\\nthe reflected gradient method was investigated. Whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak Minty\\nsolutions remains an open question (any Stampacchia solution to the VI given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak Minty\\nsolution). Another intriguing observation was made, where for cohypomonotone problems, a monotonically decreasing gradient\\nnorm was demonstrated when using EG. However, we did not observe this in our experiments, emphasizing the need to differentiate\\nthis class from problems with weak Minty solutions.\\n2Interaction dominance. The concept of \\u03b1-interaction dominance for nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was investigated,\\nand it was shown that the proximal-point method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in yand linearly if it is met in both\\ncomponents. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components, it is also negatively\\ncomonotone.\\nOptimism. The positive effects of introducing the simple modification commonly known as optimism have recently attracted the\\nattention of the machine learning community. Its name comes from online optimization. The idea dates back even further and has\\nalso been studied in the mathematical programming community.\\n2 Preliminaries\\n2.1 Notions of solution\\nWe outline the most frequently used solution concepts in the context of variational inequalities (VIs) and related areas. These\\nconcepts are typically defined with respect to a constraint set C\\u2286Rd. A Stampacchia solution of the VI given by F:Rd\\u2192Rdis a\\npoint u\\u2217such that:\\n\\u27e8F(u\\u2217), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u22650\\u2200u\\u2208C. (SVI)\\nIn this work, we only consider the unconstrained case where C=Rd, and the above condition simplifies to F(u\\u2217) = 0 . Closely\\nrelated is the following concept: A Minty solution is a point u\\u2217\\u2208Csuch that:\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u22650\\u2200u\\u2208C. (MVI)\\nFor a continuous operator F, a Minty solution of the VI is always a Stampacchia solution. The converse is generally not true but\\nholds, for example, if the operator Fis monotone. Specifically, there are nonmonotone problems with Stampacchia solutions but\\nwithout any Minty solutions.\\n2.2 Notions of monotonicity\\nThis section aims to revisit some fundamental and more contemporary concepts of monotonicity and the relationships between them.\\nAn operator Fis considered monotone if:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u22650.\\nSuch operators naturally arise as the gradients of convex functions, from convex-concave min-max problems, or from equilibrium\\nproblems.\\nTwo frequently studied notions that fall into this category are strongly monotone operators, which satisfy:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265\\u00b5\\u2225u\\u2212v\\u22252,\\nand cocoercive operators, which fulfill:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265\\u03b2\\u2225F(u)\\u2212F(v)\\u22252. (2)\\nStrongly monotone operators emerge as gradients of strongly convex functions or in strongly-convex-strongly-concave min-max\\nproblems. Cocoercive operators appear, for instance, as gradients of smooth convex functions, in which case (2) holds with \\u03b2equal\\nto the inverse of the gradient\\u2019s Lipschitz constant.\\nDeparting from monotonicity. Both of the aforementioned subclasses of monotonicity can serve as starting points for exploring\\nthe non-monotone domain. Given that general non-monotone operators may display erratic behavior, such as periodic cycles and\\nspurious attractors, it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable. First and\\nforemost is the extensively studied setting of \\u03bd-weak monotonicity:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265 \\u2212 \\u03bd\\u2225u\\u2212v\\u22252.\\nSuch operators arise as the gradients of the well-studied class of weakly convex functions, a rather general class of functions as it\\nincludes all functions without upward cusps. In particular, every smooth function with a Lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill this\\nproperty. On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity,\\nhas received much less attention and is given by:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265 \\u2212 \\u03b3\\u2225F(u)\\u2212F(v)\\u22252.\\nClearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1.\\nBehavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficient\\nto require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead of\\nmonotonicity, it is enough to ask for the operator Fto be star-monotone, i.e.,\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u22650,\\nor star-cocoercive,\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u2265\\u03b3\\u2225F(u)\\u22252.\\nIn this spirit, we can provide a new interpretation to the assumption of the existence of a weak Minty solution as asking for the\\noperator Fto be negatively star-cocoercive (with respect to at least one solution). Furthermore, we want to point out that while the\\nabove star notions are sometimes required to hold for all solutions u\\u2217, in the following we only require it to hold for a single solution.\\n33 OGDA for problems with weak Minty solutions\\nThe generalized version of OGDA, which we denote with a \\\"+\\\" to emphasize the presence of the additional parameter \\u03b3, is given by:\\nAlgorithm 1 OGDA+\\nRequire: Starting point u0=u\\u22121\\u2208Rd, step size a >0and parameter 0< \\u03b3 < 1.\\nfork= 0,1, ...do\\nuk+1=uk\\u2212a((1 + \\u03b3)F(uk)\\u2212F(uk\\u22121))\\nend for\\nTheorem 3.1.

To be able to choose a large step size a, we must decrease \\u03b3, as evident from (3). However, this degrades the algorithm\\u2019s\\nspeed by making the update steps smaller. The same effect can be observed for EG+ and is therefore not surprising. One could\\nderive an optimal \\u03b3(i.e., minimizing the right-hand side) from Theorem 3.1, but this results in a non-intuitive cubic dependence on\\n\\u03c1. In practice, the strategy of decreasing \\u03b3until convergence is achieved, but not further, yields reasonable results.\\nFurthermore, we want to point out that the condition \\u03c1 <1\\nLis precisely the best possible bound for EG+.\\n3.1 Improved bounds under monotonicity\\nWhile the above theorem also holds if the operator Fis monotone, we can modify the proof slightly to obtain a better dependence on\\nthe parameters:\\nTheorem 3.2. LetF:Rd\\u2192Rdbe monotone and L-Lipschitz.

However, we\\nwant to compare the above bound to more similar results on rates for the best iterate in terms of the operator norm. The same rate as\\nours for OGDA is shown, but requires the conservative step size bound a\\u22641\\n16L. This was later improved to a\\u22641\\n3L. All of these\\nonly deal with the case \\u03b3= 1. The only other reference that deals with a generalized (i.e., not necessarily \\u03b3= 1) version of OGDA\\nis another work, where the resulting step size condition is a\\u22642\\u2212\\u03b3\\n4L, which is strictly worse than ours for any \\u03b3. To summarize, not\\nonly do we show for the first time that the step size of a generalization of OGDA can go above1\\n2L, but we also provide the least\\nrestrictive bound for any value of \\u03b3.\\n3.2 OGDA+ stochastic\\nIn this section, we discuss the setting where, instead of the exact operator F, we only have access to a collection of independent\\nestimators F(\\u00b7, \\u03bei)at every iteration.

In the\\nweak Minty setting, this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence. Unfortunately,\\nthe current analysis does not allow for variable \\u03b3.\\n4 EG+ with adaptive step sizes\\nIn this section, we present Algorithm 3, which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the\\nLipschitz constant L, as it is typically difficult to compute in practice. Additionally, it is well known that rough estimates will lead to\\nsmall step sizes and slow convergence behavior. However, in the presence of weak Minty solutions, there is additional interest in\\nchoosing large step sizes. We observed in Theorem 3.1 and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that the\\nstep size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak Minty parameter \\u03c1to guarantee convergence at all. For these reasons, we want\\nto outline a method using adaptive step sizes, meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no line-search is carried\\nout.\\nSince the analysis of OGDA+ is already quite involved in the constant step size regime, we choose to equip EG+ with an adaptive\\nstep size which estimates the inverse of the (local) Lipschitz constant, see (4). Due to the fact that the literature on adaptive methods,\\nespecially in the context of VIs, is so vast, we do not aim to give a comprehensive review but highlight only a few with especially\\ninteresting properties. In particular, we do not want to touch on methods with a linesearch procedure, which typically result in\\nmultiple gradient computations per iteration.\\nWe use a simple and therefore widely used step size choice that naively estimates the local Lipschitz constant and forces a monotone\\ndecreasing behavior. Such step sizes have been used extensively for monotone VIs and similarly in the context of the mirror-prox\\nmethod, which corresponds to EG in the setting of (non-Euclidean) Bregman distances.\\nA version of EG with a different adaptive step size choice has been investigated, with the unique feature that it is able to achieve the\\noptimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems without modification. However, these rates are only for monotone VIs and\\nare in terms of the gap function.\\nOne of the drawbacks of adaptive methods resides in the fact that the step sizes are typically required to be nonincreasing, which\\nresults in poor behavior if a high-curvature area was visited by the iterates before reaching a low-curvature region. To the best of our\\nknowledge, the only method that is allowed to use nonmonotone step sizes to treat VIs and does not use a possibly costly linesearch\\nis the golden ratio algorithm. It comes with the additional benefit of not requiring a global bound on the Lipschitz constant of Fat\\nall. While it is known that this method converges under the stronger assumption of the existence of Minty solutions, a quantitative\\nconvergence result is still open.\\nAlgorithm 3 EG+ with adaptive step size\\nRequire: Starting points u0,\\u00afu0\\u2208Rd, initial step size a0and parameters \\u03c4\\u2208(0,1)and0< \\u03b3\\u22641.\\nfork= 0,1, ...do\\nFind the step size:\\nak= min\\u001a\\nak\\u22121,\\u03c4\\u2225\\u00afuk\\u2212\\u00afuk\\u22121\\u2225\\n\\u2225F(\\u00afuk)\\u2212F(\\u00afuk\\u22121)\\u2225\\u001b\\n(4)\\nCompute next iterate:\\nuk= \\u00afuk\\u2212akF(\\u00afuk)\\n\\u00afuk+1= \\u00afuk\\u2212ak\\u03b3F(uk).\\nend for\\nClearly, akis monotonically decreasing by construction.

The main advantage resides in the fact that the\\nLipschitz constant of the operator Fdoes not need to be known. Moreover, the step size choice presented in (4) might allow us\\nto take steps much larger than what would be suggested by a global Lipschitz constant if the iterates never, or only during later\\niterations, visit the region of high curvature (large local L). In such cases, these larger step sizes come with the additional advantage\\nthat they allow us to solve a richer class of problems, as we are able to relax the condition \\u03c1 <1\\n4Lin the case of EG+ to \\u03c1 < a \\u221e/2,\\nwhere a\\u221e= lim kak\\u2265\\u03c4/L.\\nOn the other hand, we face the problem that the bounds in Theorem 4.1 only hold after an unknown number of initial iterations when\\nak/ak+1\\u22641\\n\\u03c4is finally satisfied. In theory, this might take a long time if the curvature around the solution is much higher than in\\nthe starting area, as this will force the need to decrease the step size very late into the solution process, resulting in the quotient\\nak/ak+1being too large. This drawback could be mitigated by choosing \\u03c4smaller. However, this will result in poor performance\\ndue to small step sizes. Even for monotone problems where this type of step size has been proposed, this problem could not be\\ncircumvented, and authors instead focused on the convergence of the iterates without any rate.\\n5 Numerical experiments\\nIn the following, we compare the EG+ method with the two methods we propose: OGDA+ and EG+ with adaptive step size (see\\nAlgorithm 1 and Algorithm 3, respectively). Last but not least, we also include the CurvatureEG+ method, which is a modification\\nof EG+ that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps. In addition, a backtracking linesearch is performed with\\nan initial guess made by second-order information, whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments.\\n5.1 Von Neumann\\u2019s ratio game\\nWe consider von Neumann\\u2019s ratio game, which is given by:\\nmin\\nx\\u2208\\u2206mmax\\ny\\u2208\\u2206nV(x, y) =\\u27e8x, Ry\\u27e9\\n\\u27e8x, Sy\\u27e9, (5)\\nwhere R\\u2208Rm\\u00d7nandS\\u2208Rm\\u00d7nwith\\u27e8x, Sy\\u27e9>0for all x\\u2208\\u2206m, y\\u2208\\u2206n, with \\u2206 :={z\\u2208Rd:zi>0,Pd\\ni=1zi= 1}denoting\\nthe unit simplex. Expression (5) can be interpreted as the value V(x, y)for a stochastic game with a single state and mixed strategies.\\nWe see an illustration of a particularly difficult instance of (5). Interestingly, we still observe good convergence behavior, although\\nan estimated \\u03c1is more than ten times larger than the estimated Lipschitz constant.\\n5.2 Forsaken\\nA particularly difficult min-max toy example with a \\\"Forsaken\\\" solution was proposed and is given by:\\nmin\\nx\\u2208Rmax\\ny\\u2208Rx(y\\u22120.45) + \\u03d5(x)\\u2212\\u03d5(y), (6)\\nwhere \\u03d5(z) =1\\n6z6\\u22122\\n4z4+1\\n4z2\\u22121\\n2z. This problem exhibits a Stampacchia solution at (x\\u2217, y\\u2217)\\u2248(0.08,0.4), but also two limit\\ncycles not containing any critical point of the objective function. In addition, it was also observed that the limit cycle closer to\\nthe solution repels possible trajectories of iterates, thus \\\"shielding\\\" the solution. Later, it was noticed that, restricted to the box\\n\\u2225(x, y)\\u2225\\u221e<3, the above-mentioned solution is weak Minty with \\u03c1\\u22652\\u00b70.477761 , which is much larger than1\\n2L\\u22480.08. In line\\nwith these observations, we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by1\\nLconverge. In light of this\\nobservation, a backtracking linesearch was proposed, which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global Lipschitz\\nconstant. Similarly, our proposed adaptive step size version of EG+ (see Algorithm 3) is also able to break through the repelling\\nlimit cycle and converge to the solution. On top of this, it does so at a faster rate and without the need for additional computations in\\nthe backtracking procedure.\\n5.3 Lower bound example\\nThe following min-max problem was introduced as a lower bound on the dependence between \\u03c1andLfor EG+:\\nmin\\nx\\u2208Rmax\\ny\\u2208R\\u00b5xy+\\u03b6\\n2(x2\\u2212y2). (7)\\nIn particular, it was stated that EG+ (with any \\u03b3) and constant step size a=1\\nLconverges for this problem if and only if (0,0)is a\\nweak Minty solution with \\u03c1 <1\\u2212\\u03b3\\nL, where \\u03c1andLcan be computed explicitly in the above example and are given by:\\nL=p\\n\\u00b52+\\u03b62and \\u03c1=\\u00b52\\u2212\\u03b62\\n2\\u00b5.\\nBy choosing \\u00b5= 3and\\u03b6=\\u22121, we get exactly \\u03c1=1\\nL, therefore predicting divergence of EG+ for any \\u03b3, which is exactly what is\\nempirically observed. Although the general upper bound proved in Theorem 3.1 only states convergence in the case \\u03c1 <1\\nL, we\\nobserve rapid convergence of OGDA+ for this example, showcasing that it can drastically outperform EG+ in some scenarios.\\n66 Conclusion\\nMany intriguing questions persist in the domain of min-max problems, particularly when departing from the convex-concave\\nframework. Very recently, it was demonstrated that the O(1/k)bounds on the squared operator norm for EG and OGDA for the\\nlast iterate (and not just the best one) are valid even in the negatively comonotone setting. Deriving a comparable statement in the\\npresence of merely weak Minty solutions remains an open question.\\nIn general, our analysis and experiments seem to suggest that there is minimal benefit in employing OGDA+ over EG+ for the\\nmajority of problems, as the reduced iteration cost is counterbalanced by the smaller step size. An exception is presented by problem\\n(7), which is not covered by theory, and OGDA+ is the only method capable of converging.\\nFinally, we note that the previous paradigm in pure minimization of \\\"smaller step size ensures convergence\\\" but \\\"larger step size\\ngets there faster,\\\" where the latter is typically constrained by the reciprocal of the gradient\\u2019s Lipschitz constant, does not appear\\nto hold true for min-max problems anymore. The analysis of various methods in the presence of weak Minty solutions indicates\\nthat convergence can be lost if the step size is excessively small and sometimes needs to be larger than1\\nL, which one can typically\\nonly hope for in adaptive methods. Our EG+ method with adaptive step size accomplishes this even without the added expense of a\\nbacktracking linesearch.article graphicx\\n7\",\n          \"Synergistic Convergence of Photosynthetic Pathways\\nin Subterranean Fungal Networks\\nAbstract\\nThe perpetual oscillations of quantum fluctuations in the cosmos have been found\\nto intersect with the nuanced intricacies of botanical hieroglyphics, thereby influ-\\nencing the ephemeral dance of photons on the surface of chloroplasts, which in\\nturn modulates the synergetic harmonization of carboxylation and oxygenation pro-\\ncesses, while concurrently precipitating an existential inquiry into the paradigmatic\\nunderpinnings of floricultural axioms, and paradoxically giving rise to an unfore-\\nseen convergence of gastronomical and photosynthetic ontologies.

The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limited\\ncollaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantly\\nhindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles by\\nintroducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetrically\\naccurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal-\\nibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levels\\nof complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). A\\ntotal of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologies\\ndeveloped during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in\\n3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation in\\ndietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshop\\nchallenge and the dataset is accessible via the provided URL.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe convergence of computer vision technologies with culinary practices has pioneered innovative\\napproaches to dietary monitoring and nutritional assessment. The MetaFood Workshop Challenge\\nrepresents a landmark initiative in this emerging field, responding to the pressing demand for precise\\nand scalable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. Such\\ntechnologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked to\\ndiet.\\nBy concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual\\ninputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the\\ndisparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique\\nsolutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also\\nmeeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer\\nvision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward.\\nThese advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food\\nportion estimation across diverse applications, from individual health tracking to extensive nutritional\\ninvestigations.\\nConventional methods for assessing diet, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires\\n(FFQs), are frequently reliant on manual data entry, which is prone to inaccuracies and can be\\nburdensome. The lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images further complicates the use of regression-\\nbased methods for estimating food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By enhancing\\n3D reconstruction for food, the aim is to provide more accurate and intuitive nutritional assessment\\ntools. This technology could revolutionize the sharing of culinary experiences and significantly\\nimpact nutrition science and public health.\\nParticipants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 distinct food items from 2D images, mim-\\nicking scenarios where mobile devices equipped with depth-sensing cameras are used for dietary\\n.recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based\\non the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single\\ntop-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of\\nproposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use\\nof a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame,\\nensuring the 3D models maintained accurate real-world measurements for portion size estimation.\\nThis initiative not only expands the frontiers of 3D reconstruction technology but also sets the stage\\nfor more reliable and user-friendly real-world applications, including image-based dietary assessment.\\nThe resulting solutions hold the potential to profoundly influence nutritional intake monitoring and\\ncomprehension, supporting broader health and wellness objectives. As progress continues, innovative\\napplications are anticipated to transform personal health management, nutritional research, and the\\nwider food industry. The remainder of this report is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into the\\nexisting literature on food portion size estimation, Section 3 describes the dataset and evaluation\\nframework used in the challenge, and Sections 4, 5, and 6 discuss the methodologies and findings of\\nthe top three teams (V olETA, ININ-VIAUN, and FoodRiddle), respectively.\\n2 Related Work\\nEstimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, aiming to determine the\\nvolume, energy content, or macronutrients directly from images of meals. Unlike the well-studied\\ntask of food recognition, estimating food portions is particularly challenging due to the lack of 3D\\ninformation and physical size references necessary for accurately judging the actual size of food\\nportions. Accurate portion size estimation requires understanding the volume and density of food,\\nelements that are hard to deduce from a 2D image, underscoring the need for sophisticated techniques\\nto tackle this problem. Current methods for estimating food portions are grouped into four categories.\\nStereo-Based Approaches use multiple images to reconstruct the 3D structure of food. Some methods\\nestimate food volume using multi-view stereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while\\nothers perform two-view dense reconstruction. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has\\nalso been used for continuous, real-time food volume estimation. However, these methods are limited\\nby their need for multiple images, which is not always practical.\\nModel-Based Approaches use predefined shapes and templates to estimate volume. For instance,\\ncertain templates are assigned to foods from a library and transformed based on physical references to\\nestimate the size and location of the food. Template matching approaches estimate food volume from\\na single image, but they struggle with variations in food shapes that differ from predefined templates.\\nRecent work has used 3D food meshes as templates to align camera and object poses for portion size\\nestimation.\\nDepth Camera-Based Approaches use depth cameras to create depth maps, capturing the distance from\\nthe camera to the food. These depth maps form a voxel representation used for volume estimation.\\nThe main drawback is the need for high-quality depth maps and the extra processing required for\\nconsumer-grade depth sensors.\\nDeep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion\\nestimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an\\n\\\"Energy Distribution Map\\\" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both\\nimages and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning\\nmethods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance\\ndegrading when test images significantly differ from training data.\\nWhile these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their\\nwidespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based\\napproaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware,\\nand deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D\\nreconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting\\nto various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results,\\nand enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the\\norganization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and\\n2develop more accurate, user-friendly, and widely applicable food portion estimation techniques,\\nimpacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.\\n3 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline\\n3.1 Dataset Description\\nThe dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D\\ndataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy\\nin the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern\\nmat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,\\ndetermined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:\\n\\u2022 Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.\\n\\u2022 Medium: 30 images.\\n\\u2022 Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.\\nTable 1 details the food items included in the dataset.\\nTable 1: MetaFood Challenge Data Details\\nObject Index Food Item Difficulty Level Number of Frames\\n1 Strawberry Easy 199\\n2 Cinnamon bun Easy 200\\n3 Pork rib Easy 200\\n4 Corn Easy 200\\n5 French toast Easy 200\\n6 Sandwich Easy 200\\n7 Burger Easy 200\\n8 Cake Easy 200\\n9 Blueberry muffin Medium 30\\n10 Banana Medium 30\\n11 Salmon Medium 30\\n12 Steak Medium 30\\n13 Burrito Medium 30\\n14 Hotdog Medium 30\\n15 Chicken nugget Medium 30\\n16 Everything bagel Hard 1\\n17 Croissant Hard 1\\n18 Shrimp Hard 1\\n19 Waffle Hard 1\\n20 Pizza Hard 1\\n3.2 Evaluation Pipeline\\nThe evaluation process is split into two phases, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D\\nmodels in terms of shape (3D structure) and portion size (volume).\\n3.2.1 Phase-I: Volume Accuracy\\nIn the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used to evaluate portion size\\naccuracy, calculated as follows:\\nMAPE =1\\nnnX\\ni=1\\f\\f\\f\\fAi\\u2212Fi\\nAi\\f\\f\\f\\f\\u00d7100% (1)\\n3where Aiis the actual volume (in ml) of the i-th food item obtained from the scanned 3D food mesh,\\nandFiis the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh.\\n3.2.2 Phase-II: Shape Accuracy\\nTeams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to submit complete 3D mesh files for each food item.\\nThis phase involves several steps to ensure precision and fairness:\\n\\u2022Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final Phase-I submissions for\\nconsistency, and visual inspections are conducted to prevent rule violations.\\n\\u2022Model Alignment: Participants receive ground truth 3D models and a script to compute the\\nfinal Chamfer distance. They must align their models with the ground truth and prepare a\\ntransformation matrix for each submitted object. The final Chamfer distance is calculated\\nusing these models and matrices.\\n\\u2022Chamfer Distance Calculation: Shape accuracy is assessed using the Chamfer distance\\nmetric. Given two point sets XandY, the Chamfer distance is defined as:\\ndCD(X, Y ) =1\\n|X|X\\nx\\u2208Xmin\\ny\\u2208Y\\u2225x\\u2212y\\u22252\\n2+1\\n|Y|X\\ny\\u2208Ymin\\nx\\u2208X\\u2225x\\u2212y\\u22252\\n2 (2)\\nThis metric offers a comprehensive measure of similarity between the reconstructed 3D models and\\nthe ground truth. The final ranking is determined by combining scores from both Phase-I (volume\\naccuracy) and Phase-II (shape accuracy). Note that after the Phase-I evaluation, quality issues were\\nfound with the data for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget), so these items were excluded\\nfrom the final overall evaluation.\\n4 First Place Team - VolETA\\n4.1 Methodology\\nThe team\\u2019s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and calculate\\nprecise food volumes.\\n4.1.1 Overview\\nThe team\\u2019s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume\\nfrom RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection ensures data quality, supported by perceptual\\nhashing and blur detection. Camera pose estimation and object segmentation pave the way for neural\\nsurface reconstruction, creating detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement steps, including\\nisolated piece removal and scaling factor adjustments, enhance accuracy. This approach provides a\\nthorough solution for accurate food volume assessment, with potential uses in nutrition analysis.\\n4.1.2 The Team\\u2019s Proposal: VolETA\\nThe team starts by acquiring input data, specifically RGBD images and corresponding food object\\nmasks. The RGBD images, denoted as ID={IDi}n\\ni=1, where nis the total number of frames,\\nprovide depth information alongside RGB images. The food object masks, {Mf\\ni}n\\ni=1, help identify\\nregions of interest within these images.\\nNext, the team selects keyframes. From the set {IDi}n\\ni=1, keyframes {IK\\nj}k\\nj=1\\u2286 {IDi}n\\ni=1are\\nchosen. A method is implemented to detect and remove duplicate and blurry images, ensuring\\nhigh-quality frames. This involves applying a Gaussian blurring kernel followed by the fast Fourier\\ntransform method. Near-Image Similarity uses perceptual hashing and Hamming distance threshold-\\ning to detect similar images and retain overlapping ones. Duplicates and blurry images are excluded\\nto maintain data integrity and accuracy.\\nUsing the selected keyframes {IK\\nj}k\\nj=1, the team estimates camera poses through a method called\\nPixSfM, which involves extracting features using SuperPoint, matching them with SuperGlue, and\\nrefining them. The outputs are the camera poses {Cj}k\\nj=1, crucial for understanding the scene\\u2019s\\nspatial layout.\\n4In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segments\\nthe reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask MRfor each\\nkeyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ method\\nextends the reference object mask MRto all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference object\\nmasks {MR\\ni}n\\ni=1. This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.\\nTo create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {MR\\ni}n\\ni=1, and\\nfood object masks {MF\\ni}n\\ni=1. This step, denoted as {IR\\ni}n\\ni=1, integrates various data sources into a\\nunified format for further processing.\\nThe team converts the RGBA images {IR\\ni}n\\ni=1and camera poses {Cj}k\\nj=1into meaningful metadata\\nand modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.\\nThe modeled data Dmis input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes\\n{Rf, Rr}for the reference and food objects, providing detailed 3D representations. The team uses the\\n\\\"Remove Isolated Pieces\\\" technique to refine the meshes. Given that the scenes contain only one food\\nitem, the diameter threshold is set to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes isolated connected\\ncomponents with diameters less than or equal to 5%, resulting in a cleaned mesh {RCf, RCr}. This\\nstep ensures that only significant parts of the mesh are retained.\\nThe team manually identifies an initial scaling factor Susing the reference mesh via MeshLab. This\\nfactor is fine-tuned to Sfusing depth information and food and reference masks, ensuring accurate\\nscaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the fine-tuned scaling factor Sfis applied to the\\ncleaned food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled food mesh RFf. This step culminates in an\\naccurately scaled 3D representation of the food object, enabling precise volume estimation.\\n4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factor\\nGenerally, 3D reconstruction methods produce unitless meshes by default. To address this, the team\\nmanually determines the scaling factor by measuring the distance for each block of the reference\\nobject mesh. The average of all block lengths lavgis calculated, while the actual real-world length is\\nconstant at lreal= 0.012meters. The scaling factor S=lreal/lavgis applied to the clean food mesh\\nRCf, resulting in the final scaled food mesh RFfin meters.\\nThe team uses depth information along with food and reference object masks to validate the scaling\\nfactors. The method for assessing food size involves using overhead RGB images for each scene.\\nInitially, the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) is determined using the reference object. Subse-\\nquently, the food width ( fw) and length ( fl) are extracted using a food object mask. To determine the\\nfood height ( fh), a two-step process is followed. First, binary image segmentation is performed using\\nthe overhead depth and reference images, yielding a segmented depth image for the reference object.\\nThe average depth is then calculated using the segmented reference object depth ( dr). Similarly,\\nemploying binary image segmentation with an overhead food object mask and depth image, the\\naverage depth for the segmented food depth image ( df) is computed. The estimated food height fhis\\nthe absolute difference between dranddf. To assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the food\\nbounding box volume (fw\\u00d7fl\\u00d7fh)\\u00d7PPU is computed. The team evaluates if the scaling factor\\nSgenerates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine. Table 2 lists the scaling\\nfactors, PPU, 2D reference object dimensions, 3D food object dimensions, and potential volume.\\nFor one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team uses One-2-3-45 to reconstruct a 3D model from a single\\nRGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation to both food RGB and mask images.\\nIsolated pieces are removed from the generated mesh, and the scaling factor S, which is closer to the\\npotential volume of the clean mesh, is reused.\\n4.2 Experimental Results\\n4.2.1 Implementation settings\\nExperiments were conducted using two GPUs: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/12G and RTX 3060/6G. The\\nHamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers\\nin the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces\\nwas set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube\\n\\\"aabb scale\\\" of 1, \\\"scale\\\" of 0.15, and \\\"offset\\\" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.\\n54.2.2 VolETA Results\\nThe team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results\\nwith ground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. The team\\u2019s approach was\\napplied separately to each food scene. A one-shot food volume estimation approach was used if\\nthe number of keyframes kequaled 1; otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation was applied.\\nNotably, the keyframe selection process chose 34.8% of the total frames for the rest of the pipeline,\\nshowing the minimum frames with the highest information.\\nTable 2: List of Extracted Information Using RGBD and Masks\\nLevel Id Label Sf PPU Rw\\u00d7Rl (fw\\u00d7fl\\u00d7fh)\\n1 Strawberry 0.08955223881 0.01786 320\\u00d7360 (238 \\u00d7257\\u00d72.353)\\n2 Cinnamon bun 0.1043478261 0.02347 236\\u00d7274 (363 \\u00d7419\\u00d72.353)\\n3 Pork rib 0.1043478261 0.02381 246\\u00d7270 (435 \\u00d7778\\u00d71.176)\\nEasy 4 Corn 0.08823529412 0.01897 291\\u00d7339 (262 \\u00d7976\\u00d72.353)\\n5 French toast 0.1034482759 0.02202 266\\u00d7292 (530 \\u00d7581\\u00d72.53)\\n6 Sandwich 0.1276595745 0.02426 230\\u00d7265 (294 \\u00d7431\\u00d72.353)\\n7 Burger 0.1043478261 0.02435 208\\u00d7264 (378 \\u00d7400\\u00d72.353)\\n8 Cake 0.1276595745 0.02143 256\\u00d7300 (298 \\u00d7310\\u00d74.706)\\n9 Blueberry muffin 0.08759124088 0.01801 291\\u00d7357 (441 \\u00d7443\\u00d72.353)\\n10 Banana 0.08759124088 0.01705 315\\u00d7377 (446 \\u00d7857\\u00d71.176)\\nMedium 11 Salmon 0.1043478261 0.02390 242\\u00d7269 (201 \\u00d7303\\u00d71.176)\\n13 Burrito 0.1034482759 0.02372 244\\u00d7271 (251 \\u00d7917\\u00d72.353)\\n14 Frankfurt sandwich 0.1034482759 0.02115 266\\u00d7304 (400 \\u00d71022\\u00d72.353)\\n16 Everything bagel 0.08759124088 0.01747 306\\u00d7368 (458 \\u00d7134\\u00d71.176)\\nHard 17 Croissant 0.1276595745 0.01751 319\\u00d7367 (395 \\u00d7695\\u00d72.176)\\n18 Shrimp 0.08759124088 0.02021 249\\u00d7318 (186 \\u00d795\\u00d70.987)\\n19 Waffle 0.01034482759 0.01902 294\\u00d7338 (465 \\u00d7537\\u00d70.8)\\n20 Pizza 0.01034482759 0.01913 292\\u00d7336 (442 \\u00d7651\\u00d71.176)\\nAfter finding keyframes, PixSfM estimated the poses and point cloud.

The\\nteam adheres to a method involving corner projection matching. Specifically, utilizing the COLMAP\\ndense model, the team acquires the pose of each image along with dense point cloud data. For any\\ngiven image imgkand its extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the team initially performs threshold-based\\ncorner detection, setting the threshold at 240. This step allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates\\nof all detected corners. Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters kand the extrinsic parameters\\n[R|t]k, the point cloud is projected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of the\\ncorners, the team can identify the closest point coordinates Pk\\nifor each corner, where irepresents the\\nindex of the corner. Thus, they can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows:\\nDk\\nij= (Pk\\ni\\u2212Pk\\nj)2\\u2200i\\u0338=j (3)\\nTo determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image k, the team takes the\\nminimum value of each row of the matrix Dk(excluding the diagonal) to form the vector dk. The\\nmedian of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by Equation 4, where\\n0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm):\\nscale =0.012Pn\\ni=1med(dk)(4)\\n75.1.2 3D Reconstruction\\nThe 3D reconstruction process, depicted in Figure 10, involves two different pipelines to accommodate\\nvariations in input viewpoints. The first fifteen objects are processed using one pipeline, while the\\nlast five single-view objects are processed using another.\\nFor the initial fifteen objects, the team uses COLMAP to estimate poses and segment the food using\\nthe provided segment masks. Advanced multi-view 3D reconstruction methods are then applied to\\nreconstruct the segmented food. The team employs three different reconstruction methods: COLMAP,\\nDiffusioNeRF, and NeRF2Mesh. They select the best reconstruction results from these methods and\\nextract the mesh. The extracted mesh is scaled using the estimated scale factor, and optimization\\ntechniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh.\\nFor the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction\\nmethods, including Zero123, Zero123++, One2345, ZeroNVS, and DreamGaussian. They choose\\nZeroNVS to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution of the input image. The\\nintrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object are used, and an optimization method based\\non reprojection error refines the extrinsic parameters of the single camera. Due to limitations in\\nsingle-view reconstruction, depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular\\nimage are used to determine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, optimization techniques are\\napplied to obtain a refined mesh.\\n5.1.3 Mesh refinement\\nDuring the 3D Reconstruction phase, it was observed that the model\\u2019s results often suffered from low\\nquality due to holes on the object\\u2019s surface and substantial noise, as shown in Figure 11.\\nTo address the holes, MeshFix, an optimization method based on computational geometry, is em-\\nployed. For surface noise, Laplacian Smoothing is used for mesh smoothing operations. The\\nLaplacian Smoothing method adjusts the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring\\nvertices:\\nV(new)\\ni =V(old)\\ni+\\u03bb\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed1\\n|N(i)|X\\nj\\u2208N(i)V(old)\\nj\\u2212V(old)\\ni\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8 (5)\\nIn their implementation, the smoothing factor \\u03bbis set to 0.2, and 10 iterations are performed.\\n5.2 Experimental Results\\n5.2.1 Estimated scale factor\\nThe scale factors estimated using the described method are shown in Table 5. Each image and the\\ncorresponding reconstructed 3D model yield a scale factor, and the table presents the average scale\\nfactor for each object.\\n5.2.2 Reconstructed meshes\\nThe refined meshes obtained using the described methods are shown in Figure 12. The predicted\\nmodel volumes, ground truth model volumes, and the percentage errors between them are presented\\nin Table 6.\\n5.2.3 Alignment\\nThe team designs a multi-stage alignment method for evaluating reconstruction quality. Figure 13\\nillustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the central points of both the predicted and\\nground truth models are calculated, and the predicted model is moved to align with the central point\\nof the ground truth model. Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly\\nreducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain\\nthe final transformation matrix.\\nThe total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.\\n8Table 5: Estimated Scale Factors\\nObject Index Food Item Scale Factor\\n1 Strawberry 0.060058\\n2 Cinnamon bun 0.081829\\n3 Pork rib 0.073861\\n4 Corn 0.083594\\n5 French toast 0.078632\\n6 Sandwich 0.088368\\n7 Burger 0.103124\\n8 Cake 0.068496\\n9 Blueberry muffin 0.059292\\n10 Banana 0.058236\\n11 Salmon 0.083821\\n13 Burrito 0.069663\\n14 Hotdog 0.073766\\nTable 6: Metric of V olume\\nObject Index Predicted V olume Ground Truth Error Percentage\\n1 44.51 38.53 15.52\\n2 321.26 280.36 14.59\\n3 336.11 249.67 34.62\\n4 347.54 295.13 17.76\\n5 389.28 392.58 0.84\\n6 197.82 218.44 9.44\\n7 412.52 368.77 11.86\\n8 181.21 173.13 4.67\\n9 233.79 232.74 0.45\\n10 160.06 163.09 1.86\\n11 86.0 85.18 0.96\\n13 334.7 308.28 8.57\\n14 517.75 589.83 12.22\\n16 176.24 262.15 32.77\\n17 180.68 181.36 0.37\\n18 13.58 20.58 34.01\\n19 117.72 108.35 8.64\\n20 117.43 119.83 20.03\\n6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle\\n6.1 Methodology\\nTo achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as\\ndepicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from-\\nmotion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently,\\na sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh\\nquality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to\\nfacilitate model generation.\\n6.1.1 Multi-View Reconstruction\\nFor Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integrating\\nSuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limited\\nkeypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15.\\nIn the mesh reconstruction phase, the team\\u2019s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, which\\nemploys a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion\\n9and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized to\\nproduce a dense point cloud.\\nDuring post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outline\\nof the supporting surface, and projected the lower mesh vertices onto this surface. They utilized\\nthe reconstructed checkerboard to correct the model\\u2019s scale and employed Poisson reconstruction to\\ncreate a complete, watertight mesh of the subject.\\n6.1.2 Single-View Reconstruction\\nFor 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team utilized advanced methods such as LGM, Instant\\nMesh, and One-2-3-45 to generate an initial mesh. This initial mesh was then refined in conjunction\\nwith depth structure information.\\nTo adjust the scale, the team estimated the object\\u2019s length using the checkerboard as a reference,\\nassuming that the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D\\nobject back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object.\\n6.2 Experimental Results\\nThrough a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that\\nminimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization\\naimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion\\nof this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects\\namounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for\\nboth multi- view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.\\nTable 7: Total Errors for Different Teams on Multi-view and Single-view Data\\nTeam Multi-view (1-14) Single-view (16-20)\\nFoodRiddle 0.036362 0.019232\\nININ-VIAUN 0.041552 0.027889\\nV olETA 0.071921 0.058726\\n7 Conclusion\\nThis report examines and compiles the techniques and findings from the MetaFood Workshop\\nchallenge on 3D Food Reconstruction. The challenge sought to enhance 3D reconstruction methods\\nby concentrating on food items, tackling the distinct difficulties presented by varied textures, reflective\\nsurfaces, and intricate geometries common in culinary subjects.\\nThe competition involved 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with differing\\nnumbers of input images, specifically designed to challenge participants in creating robust reconstruc-\\ntion models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy\\nthrough Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance\\nmetric.\\nOf all participating teams, three reached the final submission stage, presenting a range of innovative\\nsolutions. Team V olETA secured first place with the best overall performance in both Phase-I and\\nPhase-II, followed by team ININ-VIAUN in second place. Additionally, the FoodRiddle team\\nexhibited superior performance in Phase-II, highlighting a competitive and high-caliber field of\\nentries for 3D mesh reconstruction. The challenge has successfully advanced the field of 3D food\\nreconstruction, demonstrating the potential for accurate volume estimation and shape reconstruction\\nin nutritional analysis and food presentation applications. The novel methods developed by the\\nparticipating teams establish a strong foundation for future research in this area, potentially leading\\nto more precise and user-friendly approaches for dietary assessment and monitoring.\\n10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

examines a specific category of structured nonconvexnonconcave minmax problems that demon strate a characteristic known as weak minty solutions this concept which has only recently been defined has already demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time we establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method ogda within this framework achieving a convergence rate of k for the most effective iteration measured by the squared operator norm a result that aligns with the extragradient method eg furthermore we introduce a modified version of eg that incorporates an adaptive step size eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problem s specific parameters introduction the recent advancements in machine learning models particularly those that can be formulated as minmax optimization problems have generated significant interest in saddle point problems examples of these models include generative adversarial networks adversarial learning frameworks adversarial example games and actorcritic methods while practical methods have been developed that generally perform well the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization component and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited with some research even suggesting intractability in certain cases a specific subset of nonconvexnonconcave minmax problems was analyzed and it was found that the extragradient method eg exhibited favorable convergence behavior in experimental settings surprisingly these problems did not appear to possess any of the recognized favorable characteristics such as monotonicity or minty solutions subsequently a suitable concept was identified see assumption which is less restrictive than the presence of a minty solution a condition frequently employed in the existing literature and also extends the idea of negative comonotonicity because of these properties that unify and generalize the concept of weak minty solutions was quickly investigated assumption weak minty solution for a given operator frd rd there is a point u rdand a parameter such that fu u u fu u rd moreover it has been demonstrated that a modified version of eg is capable of addressing problems with such solutions achieving a complexity of o for the squared operator norm this adaptation referred to as eg is based on a bold extrapolation step followed by a cautious update step a similar step size approach has been previously examined in the context of a stochastic variant of eg in a similar vein we explore a variation of the optimistic gradient descent ascent ogda also known as forwardreflected backward forb we address the following question with an affirmative answer can ogda achieve convergence guarantees comparable to those of eg when dealing with weak minty solutions specifically we demonstrate that a modified version of the ogda method defined for a step size a and a parameter as follows uk uk af uk uk uk afuk k can achieve the same convergence bounds as eg by requiring only a single gradient oracle call in each iteration it is worth noting that ogda is most frequently expressed in a form where however two recent studies have examined a more generalized coefficient while these earlier studies focused on the monotone setting the true significance of becomesapparent only when dealing with weak minty solutions in this context we find that must be greater than to ensure convergence a phenomenon that is not observed in monotone problems when examining a general smooth minmax problem min xmax yfx y the operator fmentioned in assumption naturally emerges as fu xfx y yfx ywithu x y however by examining saddle point problems from the broader viewpoint of variational inequalities vis through the operator f we can concurrently address more scenarios such as certain equilibrium problems the parameter in the definition of weak minty solutions is crucial for both the analysis and the experiments specifically it is essential that the step size exceeds a value proportional to simultaneously as is typical the step size is limited from above by the inverse of the lipschitz constant of f for instance since some researchers require the step size to be less than l their convergence claim is valid only if l this condition was later improved to lfor the choice and to lfor even smaller values of as in the monotone setting ogda requires a smaller step size than eg nevertheless through a different analysis we are able to match the most general condition on the weak minty parameter lfor appropriate anda contribution our contributions are summarized as follows we establish a new convergence rate of ok measured by the squared operator norm for a modified version of ogda which we call ogda this rate matches that of eg and builds upon the recently introduced concept of weak solutions to the minty variational inequality even when a stronger condition is imposed specifically that the operator is also monotone we enhance the range of feasible step sizes for ogda and obtain the most favorable result known for the standard method we demonstrate a complexity bound of o for a stochastic variant of the ogda method we also introduce an adaptive step size version of eg this version achieves the same convergence guarantees without requiring any knowledge of the lipschitz constant of the operator f consequently it can potentially take larger steps in areas with low curvature enabling convergence where a fixed step size strategy might fail related literature we will concentrate on the nonconvexnonconcave setting as there is a substantial body of work on convergence rates in terms of a gap function or distance to a solution for monotone problems as well as generalizations such as nonconvexconcave convexnonconcave or under the polyak ojasiewicz assumption weak minty it was observed that a specific parameterization of the von neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution termed weak minty without having any of the previously known characteristics like negative comonotonicity or minty solutions convergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for eg provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as the update step subsequently it was shown that the condition on the weak minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the length of the update step and this is done adaptively to avoid the need for additional hyperparameters a backtracking line search is also proposed which may incur extra gradient computations or require secondorder information in contrast to the adaptive step size we propose in algorithm a different approach is taken by focusing on the minmax setting and using multiple ascent steps per descent step achieving the same okrate as eg minty solutions numerous studies have presented various methods for scenarios where the problem at hand has a minty solution it was shown that weakly monotone vis can be solved by iteratively adding a quadratic proximity term and repeatedly optimizing the resulting strongly monotone vi using any convergent method the convergence of the ogda method was proven but without a specific rate it was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm graal is valid without any changes while the assumption that a minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting it is challenging to find nonmonotone problems that possess such solutions in our setting as per assumption the minty inequality mvi can be violated at any point by a factor proportional to the squared operator norm negative comonotonicity although previously studied under the term cohypomonotonicity the concept of negative comono tonicity has recently been explored it offers a generalization of monotonicity but in a direction distinct from the concept of minty solutions and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context an anchored version of eg was studied and an improved convergence rate of okin terms of the squared operator norm was shown similarly an accelerated version of the reflected gradient method was investigated whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak minty solutions remains an open question any stampacchia solution to the vi given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak minty solution another intriguing observation was made where for cohypomonotone problems a monotonically decreasing gradient norm was demonstrated when using eg however we did not observe this in our experiments emphasizing the need to differentiate this class from problems with weak minty solutions interaction dominance the concept of interaction dominance for nonconvexnonconcave minmax problems was investigated and it was shown that the proximalpoint method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in yand linearly if it is met in both components furthermore it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components it is also negatively comonotone optimism the positive effects of introducing the simple modification commonly known as optimism have recently attracted the attention of the machine learning community its name comes from online optimization the idea dates back even further and has also been studied in the mathematical programming community preliminaries notions of solution we outline the most frequently used solution concepts in the context of variational inequalities vis and related areas these concepts are typically defined with respect to a constraint set c rd a stampacchia solution of the vi given by frd rdis a point u such that fu u u u c svi in this work we only consider the unconstrained case where crd and the above condition simplifies to fu closely related is the following concept a minty solution is a point u csuch that fu u u u c mvi for a continuous operator f a minty solution of the vi is always a stampacchia solution the converse is generally not true but holds for example if the operator fis monotone specifically there are nonmonotone problems with stampacchia solutions but without any minty solutions notions of monotonicity this section aims to revisit some fundamental and more contemporary concepts of monotonicity and the relationships between them an operator fis considered monotone if fu fv u v such operators naturally arise as the gradients of convex functions from convexconcave minmax problems or from equilibrium problems two frequently studied notions that fall into this category are strongly monotone operators which satisfy fu fv u v u v and cocoercive operators which fulfill fu fv u v fu fv strongly monotone operators emerge as gradients of strongly convex functions or in stronglyconvexstronglyconcave minmax problems cocoercive operators appear for instance as gradients of smooth convex functions in which case holds with equal to the inverse of the gradient s lipschitz constant departing from monotonicity both of the aforementioned subclasses of monotonicity can serve as starting points for exploring the nonmonotone domain given that general nonmonotone operators may display erratic behavior such as periodic cycles and spurious attractors it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable first and foremost is the extensively studied setting of weak monotonicity fu fv u v u v such operators arise as the gradients of the wellstudied class of weakly convex functions a rather general class of functions as it includes all functions without upward cusps in particular every smooth function with a lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill this property on the other hand extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients referred to as cohypomonotonicity has received much less attention and is given by fu fv u v fu fv clearly if a stampacchia solution exists for such an operator then it also fulfills assumption behavior with respect to the solution while the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature it is usually sufficient to require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a stampacchia solution this means that instead of monotonicity it is enough to ask for the operator fto be starmonotone ie fu u u or starcocoercive fu u u fu in this spirit we can provide a new interpretation to the assumption of the existence of a weak minty solution as asking for the operator fto be negatively starcocoercive with respect to at least one solution furthermore we want to point out that while the above star notions are sometimes required to hold for all solutions u in the following we only require it to hold for a single solution ogda for problems with weak minty solutions the generalized version of ogda which we denote with a to emphasize the presence of the additional parameter is given by algorithm ogda require starting point uu rd step size a and parameter fork do ukuk a fuk fuk end for theorem letfrd rdbellipschitz continuous satisfying assumption with l and let ukk be the iterates generated by algorithm with step size asatisfying a and al then for all k min ik fui ka a uafu u in particular as long as l we can find a small enough such that the above bound holds the first observation is that we would like to choose aas large as possible as this allows us to treat the largest class of problems with a to be able to choose a large step size a we must decrease as evident from however this degrades the algorithm s speed by making the update steps smaller the same effect can be observed for eg and is therefore not surprising one could derive an optimal ie minimizing the righthand side from theorem but this results in a nonintuitive cubic dependence on in practice the strategy of decreasing until convergence is achieved but not further yields reasonable results furthermore we want to point out that the condition lis precisely the best possible bound for eg improved bounds under monotonicity while the above theorem also holds if the operator fis monotone we can modify the proof slightly to obtain a better dependence on the parameters theorem letfrd rdbe monotone and llipschitz if al for then the iterates generated by ogda fulfill min ik fui ka uafu u in particular we can choose anda l there are different works discussing the convergence of ogda in terms of the iterates or a gap function with a l however we want to compare the above bound to more similar results on rates for the best iterate in terms of the operator norm the same rate as ours for ogda is shown but requires the conservative step size bound a l this was later improved to a l all of these only deal with the case the only other reference that deals with a generalized ie not necessarily version of ogda is another work where the resulting step size condition is a l which is strictly worse than ours for any to summarize not only do we show for the first time that the step size of a generalization of ogda can go above l but we also provide the least restrictive bound for any value of ogda stochastic in this section we discuss the setting where instead of the exact operator f we only have access to a collection of independent estimators f iat every iteration we assume here that the estimator fis unbiased ie efuk uk fuk and has bounded variance e fuk fuk we show that we can still guarantee convergence by using batch sizes bof order o algorithm stochastic ogda require starting point uu rd step size a parameter and batch size b fork do sample iid ib iand compute estimator

visit an stationary point such that minik e fui we require ka a ua g u max al calls to the stochastic oracle f with large batch sizes of order o in practice large batch sizes of order o are typically not desirable instead a small or decreasing step size is preferred in the weak minty setting this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence unfortunately the current analysis does not allow for variable eg with adaptive step sizes in this section we present algorithm which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the lipschitz constant l as it is typically difficult to compute in practice additionally it is well known that rough estimates will lead to small step sizes and slow convergence behavior however in the presence of weak minty solutions there is additional interest in choosing large step sizes we observed in theorem and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that the step size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak minty parameter to guarantee convergence at all for these reasons we want to outline a method using adaptive step sizes meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no linesearch is carried out since the analysis of ogda is already quite involved in the constant step size regime we choose to equip eg with an adaptive step size which estimates the inverse of the local lipschitz constant see due to the fact that the literature on adaptive methods especially in the context of vis is so vast we do not aim to give a comprehensive review but highlight only a few with especially interesting properties in particular we do not want to touch on methods with a linesearch procedure which typically result in multiple gradient computations per iteration we use a simple and therefore widely used step size choice that naively estimates the local lipschitz constant and forces a monotone decreasing behavior such step sizes have been used extensively for monotone vis and similarly in the context of the mirrorprox method which corresponds to eg in the setting of noneuclidean bregman distances a version of eg with a different adaptive step size choice has been investigated with the unique feature that it is able to achieve the optimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems without modification however these rates are only for monotone vis and are in terms of the gap function one of the drawbacks of adaptive methods resides in the fact that the step sizes are typically required to be nonincreasing which results in poor behavior if a highcurvature area was visited by the iterates before reaching a lowcurvature region to the best of our knowledge the only method that is allowed to use nonmonotone step sizes to treat vis and does not use a possibly costly linesearch is the golden ratio algorithm it comes with the additional benefit of not requiring a global bound on the lipschitz constant of fat all while it is known that this method converges under the stronger assumption of the existence of minty solutions a quantitative convergence result is still open algorithm eg with adaptive step size

monotonically decreasing by construction moreover it is bounded away from zero by the simple observation that ak mina l the sequence therefore converges to a positive number which we denote by a lim kak theorem letfrd rdbellipschitz that satisfies assumption where u denotes any weak minty solution with a and let ukk be the iterates generated by algorithm with and then there exists a k nsuch that min ikk fuk k kl a uk u algorithm presented above provides several benefits but also some drawbacks the main advantage resides in the fact that the lipschitz constant of the operator fdoes not need to be known moreover the step size choice presented in might allow us to take steps much larger than what would be suggested by a global lipschitz constant if the iterates never or only during later iterations visit the region of high curvature large local l in such cases these larger step sizes come with the additional advantage that they allow us to solve a richer class of problems as we are able to relax the condition lin the case of eg to a where a lim kak l on the other hand we face the problem that the bounds in theorem only hold after an unknown number of initial iterations when akak is finally satisfied in theory this might take a long time if the curvature around the solution is much higher than in the starting area as this will force the need to decrease the step size very late into the solution process resulting in the quotient akakbeing too large this drawback could be mitigated by choosing smaller however this will result in poor performance due to small step sizes even for monotone problems where this type of step size has been proposed this problem could not be circumvented and authors instead focused on the convergence of the iterates without any rate numerical experiments in the following we compare the eg method with the two methods we propose ogda and eg with adaptive step size see algorithm and algorithm respectively last but not least we also include the curvatureeg method which is a modification of eg that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps in addition a backtracking linesearch is performed with an initial guess made by secondorder information whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments von neumann s ratio game we consider von neumann s ratio game which is given by min x mmax y nvx y x ry x sy where r rm nands rm nwith x sy for all x m y n with z rdzipd izi denoting the unit simplex expression can be interpreted as the value vx yfor a stochastic game with a single state and mixed strategies we see an illustration of a particularly difficult instance of interestingly we still observe good convergence behavior although an estimated is more than ten times larger than the estimated lipschitz constant forsaken a particularly difficult minmax toy example with a forsaken solution was proposed and is given by min x rmax y rxy x y where z z z z z this problem exhibits a stampacchia solution at x y but also two limit cycles not containing any critical point of the objective function in addition it was also observed that the limit cycle closer to the solution repels possible trajectories of iterates thus shielding the solution later it was noticed that restricted to the box x y the abovementioned solution is weak minty with which is much larger than l in line with these observations we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by lconverge in light of this observation a backtracking linesearch was proposed which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global lipschitz constant similarly our proposed adaptive step size version of eg see algorithm is also able to break through the repelling limit cycle and converge to the solution on top of this it does so at a faster rate and without the need for additional computations in the backtracking procedure lower bound example the following minmax problem was introduced as a lower bound on the dependence between andlfor eg min x rmax y r xy x y in particular it was stated that eg with any and constant step size a lconverges for this problem if and only if is a weak minty solution with l where andlcan be computed explicitly in the above example and are given by lp and by choosing and we get exactly l therefore predicting divergence of eg for any which is exactly what is empirically observed although the general upper bound proved in theorem only states convergence in the case l we observe rapid convergence of ogda for this example showcasing that it can drastically outperform eg in some scenarios conclusion many intriguing questions persist in the domain of minmax problems particularly when departing from the convexconcave framework very recently it was demonstrated that the okbounds on the squared operator norm for eg and ogda for the last iterate and not just the best one are valid even in the negatively comonotone setting deriving a comparable statement in the presence of merely weak minty solutions remains an open question in general our analysis and experiments seem to suggest that there is minimal benefit in employing ogda over eg for the majority of problems as the reduced iteration cost is counterbalanced by the smaller step size an exception is presented by problem which is not covered by theory and ogda is the only method capable of converging finally we note that the previous paradigm in pure minimization of smaller step size ensures convergence but larger step size gets there faster where the latter is typically constrained by the reciprocal of the gradient s lipschitz constant does not appear to hold true for minmax problems anymore the analysis of various methods in the presence of weak minty solutions indicates that convergence can be lost if the step size is excessively small and sometimes needs to be larger than l which one can typically only hope for in adaptive methods our eg method with adaptive step size accomplishes this even without the added expense of a backtracking linesearcharticle graphicx\",\n          \"synergistic convergence of photosynthetic pathways in subterranean

This concept, which has only recently been defined, has\\nalready demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time.\\nWe establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method (OGDA) within\\nthis framework, achieving a convergence rate of 1/k for the most effective iteration, measured by the squared\\noperator norm, a result that aligns with the extragradient method (EG). Furthermore, we introduce a modified\\nversion of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problem\\u2019s\\nspecific parameters.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems,\\nhave generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks,\\nadversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developed\\nthat generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization\\ncomponent and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability in\\ncertain cases.\\nA specific subset of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was analyzed, and it was found that the extragradient method (EG)\\nexhibited favorable convergence behavior in experimental settings. Surprisingly, these problems did not appear to possess any of\\nthe recognized favorable characteristics, such as monotonicity or Minty solutions. Subsequently, a suitable concept was identified\\n(see Assumption 1), which is less restrictive than the presence of a Minty solution (a condition frequently employed in the existing\\nliterature) and also extends the idea of negative comonotonicity. Because of these properties that unify and generalize, the concept of\\nweak Minty solutions was quickly investigated.\\nAssumption 1 (Weak Minty solution). For a given operator F:Rd\\u2192Rd, there is a point u\\u2217\\u2208Rdand a parameter \\u03c1 >0such that:\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u2265 \\u2212\\u03c1\\n2\\u2225F(u)\\u22252\\u2200u\\u2208Rd. (1)\\nMoreover, it has been demonstrated that a modified version of EG is capable of addressing problems with such solutions, achieving\\na complexity of O(\\u03f5\\u22121)for the squared operator norm. This adaptation, referred to as EG+, is based on a bold extrapolation step\\nfollowed by a cautious update step. A similar step size approach has been previously examined in the context of a stochastic variant\\nof EG.\\nIn a similar vein, we explore a variation of the optimistic gradient descent ascent (OGDA), also known as Forward-Reflected-\\nBackward (FoRB). We address the following question with an affirmative answer:\\nCan OGDA achieve convergence guarantees comparable to those of EG when dealing with weak Minty solutions?\\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that a modified version of the OGDA method, defined for a step size a >0and a parameter 0< \\u03b3\\u22641\\nas follows:\\nuk= \\u00afuk\\u2212aF(\\u00afuk),\\n\\u00afuk+1= \\u00afuk\\u2212\\u03b3aF(uk),\\u2200k\\u22650,\\ncan achieve the same convergence bounds as EG+ by requiring only a single gradient oracle call in each iteration.\\nIt is worth noting that OGDA is most frequently expressed in a form where \\u03b3= 1. However, two recent studies have examined\\na more generalized coefficient. While these earlier studies focused on the monotone setting, the true significance of \\u03b3becomesapparent only when dealing with weak Minty solutions. In this context, we find that \\u03b3must be greater than 1 to ensure convergence,\\na phenomenon that is not observed in monotone problems.\\nWhen examining a general smooth min-max problem:\\nmin\\nxmax\\nyf(x, y)\\nthe operator Fmentioned in Assumption 1 naturally emerges as F(u) := [\\u2207xf(x, y),\\u2212\\u2207yf(x, y)]withu= (x, y). However,\\nby examining saddle point problems from the broader viewpoint of variational inequalities (VIs) through the operator F, we can\\nconcurrently address more scenarios, such as certain equilibrium problems.\\nThe parameter \\u03c1in the definition of weak Minty solutions (1) is crucial for both the analysis and the experiments. Specifically, it\\nis essential that the step size exceeds a value proportional to \\u03c1. Simultaneously, as is typical, the step size is limited from above\\nby the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of F. For instance, since some researchers require the step size to be less than1\\n4L, their\\nconvergence claim is valid only if \\u03c1 <1\\n4L. This condition was later improved to \\u03c1 <1\\n2Lfor the choice \\u03b3= 1and to \\u03c1 <1\\nLfor\\neven smaller values of \\u03b3. As in the monotone setting, OGDA requires a smaller step size than EG. Nevertheless, through a different\\nanalysis, we are able to match the most general condition on the weak Minty parameter \\u03c1 <1\\nLfor appropriate \\u03b3anda.\\n1.1 Contribution\\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\\n1.We establish a new convergence rate of O(1/k), measured by the squared operator norm, for a modified version of OGDA,\\nwhich we call OGDA+. This rate matches that of EG and builds upon the recently introduced concept of weak solutions to\\nthe Minty variational inequality.\\n2.Even when a stronger condition is imposed, specifically that the operator is also monotone, we enhance the range of feasible\\nstep sizes for OGDA+ and obtain the most favorable result known for the standard method ( \\u03b3= 1).\\n3. We demonstrate a complexity bound of O(\\u03f5\\u22122)for a stochastic variant of the OGDA+ method.\\n4.We also introduce an adaptive step size version of EG+. This version achieves the same convergence guarantees without\\nrequiring any knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the operator F. Consequently, it can potentially take larger steps in\\nareas with low curvature, enabling convergence where a fixed step size strategy might fail.\\n1.2 Related literature\\nWe will concentrate on the nonconvex-nonconcave setting, as there is a substantial body of work on convergence rates in terms of a gap\\nfunction or distance to a solution for monotone problems, as well as generalizations such as nonconvex-concave, convex-nonconcave,\\nor under the Polyak-\\u0141ojasiewicz assumption.\\nWeak Minty. It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution,\\ntermed \\\"weak Minty,\\\" without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions.\\nConvergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as\\nthe update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the\\nlength of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search is\\nalso proposed, which may incur extra gradient computations or require second-order information (in contrast to the adaptive step\\nsize we propose in Algorithm 3). A different approach is taken by focusing on the min-max setting and using multiple ascent steps\\nper descent step, achieving the same O(1/k)rate as EG.\\nMinty solutions. Numerous studies have presented various methods for scenarios where the problem at hand has a Minty solution.\\nIt was shown that weakly monotone VIs can be solved by iteratively adding a quadratic proximity term and repeatedly optimizing\\nthe resulting strongly monotone VI using any convergent method. The convergence of the OGDA method was proven, but without a\\nspecific rate. It was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm (GRAAL) is valid without any changes. While\\nthe assumption that a Minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting, it is challenging to find non-monotone\\nproblems that possess such solutions. In our setting, as per Assumption 1, the Minty inequality (MVI) can be violated at any point\\nby a factor proportional to the squared operator norm.\\nNegative comonotonicity. Although previously studied under the term \\\"cohypomonotonicity,\\\" the concept of negative comono-\\ntonicity has recently been explored. It offers a generalization of monotonicity, but in a direction distinct from the concept of Minty\\nsolutions, and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context. An anchored version of EG was studied, and\\nan improved convergence rate of O(1/k2)(in terms of the squared operator norm) was shown. Similarly, an accelerated version of\\nthe reflected gradient method was investigated. Whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak Minty\\nsolutions remains an open question (any Stampacchia solution to the VI given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak Minty\\nsolution). Another intriguing observation was made, where for cohypomonotone problems, a monotonically decreasing gradient\\nnorm was demonstrated when using EG. However, we did not observe this in our experiments, emphasizing the need to differentiate\\nthis class from problems with weak Minty solutions.\\n2Interaction dominance. The concept of \\u03b1-interaction dominance for nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was investigated,\\nand it was shown that the proximal-point method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in yand linearly if it is met in both\\ncomponents. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components, it is also negatively\\ncomonotone.\\nOptimism. The positive effects of introducing the simple modification commonly known as optimism have recently attracted the\\nattention of the machine learning community. Its name comes from online optimization. The idea dates back even further and has\\nalso been studied in the mathematical programming community.\\n2 Preliminaries\\n2.1 Notions of solution\\nWe outline the most frequently used solution concepts in the context of variational inequalities (VIs) and related areas. These\\nconcepts are typically defined with respect to a constraint set C\\u2286Rd. A Stampacchia solution of the VI given by F:Rd\\u2192Rdis a\\npoint u\\u2217such that:\\n\\u27e8F(u\\u2217), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u22650\\u2200u\\u2208C. (SVI)\\nIn this work, we only consider the unconstrained case where C=Rd, and the above condition simplifies to F(u\\u2217) = 0 . Closely\\nrelated is the following concept: A Minty solution is a point u\\u2217\\u2208Csuch that:\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u22650\\u2200u\\u2208C. (MVI)\\nFor a continuous operator F, a Minty solution of the VI is always a Stampacchia solution. The converse is generally not true but\\nholds, for example, if the operator Fis monotone. Specifically, there are nonmonotone problems with Stampacchia solutions but\\nwithout any Minty solutions.\\n2.2 Notions of monotonicity\\nThis section aims to revisit some fundamental and more contemporary concepts of monotonicity and the relationships between them.\\nAn operator Fis considered monotone if:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u22650.\\nSuch operators naturally arise as the gradients of convex functions, from convex-concave min-max problems, or from equilibrium\\nproblems.\\nTwo frequently studied notions that fall into this category are strongly monotone operators, which satisfy:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265\\u00b5\\u2225u\\u2212v\\u22252,\\nand cocoercive operators, which fulfill:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265\\u03b2\\u2225F(u)\\u2212F(v)\\u22252. (2)\\nStrongly monotone operators emerge as gradients of strongly convex functions or in strongly-convex-strongly-concave min-max\\nproblems. Cocoercive operators appear, for instance, as gradients of smooth convex functions, in which case (2) holds with \\u03b2equal\\nto the inverse of the gradient\\u2019s Lipschitz constant.\\nDeparting from monotonicity. Both of the aforementioned subclasses of monotonicity can serve as starting points for exploring\\nthe non-monotone domain. Given that general non-monotone operators may display erratic behavior, such as periodic cycles and\\nspurious attractors, it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable. First and\\nforemost is the extensively studied setting of \\u03bd-weak monotonicity:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265 \\u2212 \\u03bd\\u2225u\\u2212v\\u22252.\\nSuch operators arise as the gradients of the well-studied class of weakly convex functions, a rather general class of functions as it\\nincludes all functions without upward cusps. In particular, every smooth function with a Lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill this\\nproperty. On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity,\\nhas received much less attention and is given by:\\n\\u27e8F(u)\\u2212F(v), u\\u2212v\\u27e9 \\u2265 \\u2212 \\u03b3\\u2225F(u)\\u2212F(v)\\u22252.\\nClearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1.\\nBehavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficient\\nto require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead of\\nmonotonicity, it is enough to ask for the operator Fto be star-monotone, i.e.,\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u22650,\\nor star-cocoercive,\\n\\u27e8F(u), u\\u2212u\\u2217\\u27e9 \\u2265\\u03b3\\u2225F(u)\\u22252.\\nIn this spirit, we can provide a new interpretation to the assumption of the existence of a weak Minty solution as asking for the\\noperator Fto be negatively star-cocoercive (with respect to at least one solution).

To be able to choose a large step size a, we must decrease \\u03b3, as evident from (3). However, this degrades the algorithm\\u2019s\\nspeed by making the update steps smaller. The same effect can be observed for EG+ and is therefore not surprising. One could\\nderive an optimal \\u03b3(i.e., minimizing the right-hand side) from Theorem 3.1, but this results in a non-intuitive cubic dependence on\\n\\u03c1. In practice, the strategy of decreasing \\u03b3until convergence is achieved, but not further, yields reasonable results.\\nFurthermore, we want to point out that the condition \\u03c1 <1\\nLis precisely the best possible bound for EG+.\\n3.1 Improved bounds under monotonicity\\nWhile the above theorem also holds if the operator Fis monotone, we can modify the proof slightly to obtain a better dependence on\\nthe parameters:\\nTheorem 3.2.

However, we\\nwant to compare the above bound to more similar results on rates for the best iterate in terms of the operator norm. The same rate as\\nours for OGDA is shown, but requires the conservative step size bound a\\u22641\\n16L. This was later improved to a\\u22641\\n3L. All of these\\nonly deal with the case \\u03b3= 1. The only other reference that deals with a generalized (i.e., not necessarily \\u03b3= 1) version of OGDA\\nis another work, where the resulting step size condition is a\\u22642\\u2212\\u03b3\\n4L, which is strictly worse than ours for any \\u03b3. To summarize, not\\nonly do we show for the first time that the step size of a generalization of OGDA can go above1\\n2L, but we also provide the least\\nrestrictive bound for any value of \\u03b3.\\n3.2 OGDA+ stochastic\\nIn this section, we discuss the setting where, instead of the exact operator F, we only have access to a collection of independent\\nestimators F(\\u00b7, \\u03bei)at every iteration.

In the\\nweak Minty setting, this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence. Unfortunately,\\nthe current analysis does not allow for variable \\u03b3.\\n4 EG+ with adaptive step sizes\\nIn this section, we present Algorithm 3, which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the\\nLipschitz constant L, as it is typically difficult to compute in practice. Additionally, it is well known that rough estimates will lead to\\nsmall step sizes and slow convergence behavior. However, in the presence of weak Minty solutions, there is additional interest in\\nchoosing large step sizes. We observed in Theorem 3.1 and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that the\\nstep size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak Minty parameter \\u03c1to guarantee convergence at all. For these reasons, we want\\nto outline a method using adaptive step sizes, meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no line-search is carried\\nout.\\nSince the analysis of OGDA+ is already quite involved in the constant step size regime, we choose to equip EG+ with an adaptive\\nstep size which estimates the inverse of the (local) Lipschitz constant, see (4). Due to the fact that the literature on adaptive methods,\\nespecially in the context of VIs, is so vast, we do not aim to give a comprehensive review but highlight only a few with especially\\ninteresting properties. In particular, we do not want to touch on methods with a linesearch procedure, which typically result in\\nmultiple gradient computations per iteration.\\nWe use a simple and therefore widely used step size choice that naively estimates the local Lipschitz constant and forces a monotone\\ndecreasing behavior. Such step sizes have been used extensively for monotone VIs and similarly in the context of the mirror-prox\\nmethod, which corresponds to EG in the setting of (non-Euclidean) Bregman distances.\\nA version of EG with a different adaptive step size choice has been investigated, with the unique feature that it is able to achieve the\\noptimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems without modification. However, these rates are only for monotone VIs and\\nare in terms of the gap function.\\nOne of the drawbacks of adaptive methods resides in the fact that the step sizes are typically required to be nonincreasing, which\\nresults in poor behavior if a high-curvature area was visited by the iterates before reaching a low-curvature region. To the best of our\\nknowledge, the only method that is allowed to use nonmonotone step sizes to treat VIs and does not use a possibly costly linesearch\\nis the golden ratio algorithm. It comes with the additional benefit of not requiring a global bound on the Lipschitz constant of Fat\\nall. While it is known that this method converges under the stronger assumption of the existence of Minty solutions, a quantitative\\nconvergence result is still open.\\nAlgorithm 3 EG+ with adaptive step size\\nRequire: Starting points u0,\\u00afu0\\u2208Rd, initial step size a0and parameters \\u03c4\\u2208(0,1)and0< \\u03b3\\u22641.\\nfork= 0,1, ...do\\nFind the step size:\\nak= min\\u001a\\nak\\u22121,\\u03c4\\u2225\\u00afuk\\u2212\\u00afuk\\u22121\\u2225\\n\\u2225F(\\u00afuk)\\u2212F(\\u00afuk\\u22121)\\u2225\\u001b\\n(4)\\nCompute next iterate:\\nuk= \\u00afuk\\u2212akF(\\u00afuk)\\n\\u00afuk+1= \\u00afuk\\u2212ak\\u03b3F(uk).\\nend for\\nClearly, akis monotonically decreasing by construction.

The main advantage resides in the fact that the\\nLipschitz constant of the operator Fdoes not need to be known. Moreover, the step size choice presented in (4) might allow us\\nto take steps much larger than what would be suggested by a global Lipschitz constant if the iterates never, or only during later\\niterations, visit the region of high curvature (large local L). In such cases, these larger step sizes come with the additional advantage\\nthat they allow us to solve a richer class of problems, as we are able to relax the condition \\u03c1 <1\\n4Lin the case of EG+ to \\u03c1 < a \\u221e/2,\\nwhere a\\u221e= lim kak\\u2265\\u03c4/L.\\nOn the other hand, we face the problem that the bounds in Theorem 4.1 only hold after an unknown number of initial iterations when\\nak/ak+1\\u22641\\n\\u03c4is finally satisfied. In theory, this might take a long time if the curvature around the solution is much higher than in\\nthe starting area, as this will force the need to decrease the step size very late into the solution process, resulting in the quotient\\nak/ak+1being too large. This drawback could be mitigated by choosing \\u03c4smaller. However, this will result in poor performance\\ndue to small step sizes. Even for monotone problems where this type of step size has been proposed, this problem could not be\\ncircumvented, and authors instead focused on the convergence of the iterates without any rate.\\n5 Numerical experiments\\nIn the following, we compare the EG+ method with the two methods we propose: OGDA+ and EG+ with adaptive step size (see\\nAlgorithm 1 and Algorithm 3, respectively). Last but not least, we also include the CurvatureEG+ method, which is a modification\\nof EG+ that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps. In addition, a backtracking linesearch is performed with\\nan initial guess made by second-order information, whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments.\\n5.1 Von Neumann\\u2019s ratio game\\nWe consider von Neumann\\u2019s ratio game, which is given by:\\nmin\\nx\\u2208\\u2206mmax\\ny\\u2208\\u2206nV(x, y) =\\u27e8x, Ry\\u27e9\\n\\u27e8x, Sy\\u27e9, (5)\\nwhere R\\u2208Rm\\u00d7nandS\\u2208Rm\\u00d7nwith\\u27e8x, Sy\\u27e9>0for all x\\u2208\\u2206m, y\\u2208\\u2206n, with \\u2206 :={z\\u2208Rd:zi>0,Pd\\ni=1zi= 1}denoting\\nthe unit simplex. Expression (5) can be interpreted as the value V(x, y)for a stochastic game with a single state and mixed strategies.\\nWe see an illustration of a particularly difficult instance of (5). Interestingly, we still observe good convergence behavior, although\\nan estimated \\u03c1is more than ten times larger than the estimated Lipschitz constant.\\n5.2 Forsaken\\nA particularly difficult min-max toy example with a \\\"Forsaken\\\" solution was proposed and is given by:\\nmin\\nx\\u2208Rmax\\ny\\u2208Rx(y\\u22120.45) + \\u03d5(x)\\u2212\\u03d5(y), (6)\\nwhere \\u03d5(z) =1\\n6z6\\u22122\\n4z4+1\\n4z2\\u22121\\n2z. This problem exhibits a Stampacchia solution at (x\\u2217, y\\u2217)\\u2248(0.08,0.4), but also two limit\\ncycles not containing any critical point of the objective function. In addition, it was also observed that the limit cycle closer to\\nthe solution repels possible trajectories of iterates, thus \\\"shielding\\\" the solution. Later, it was noticed that, restricted to the box\\n\\u2225(x, y)\\u2225\\u221e<3, the above-mentioned solution is weak Minty with \\u03c1\\u22652\\u00b70.477761 , which is much larger than1\\n2L\\u22480.08. In line\\nwith these observations, we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by1\\nLconverge. In light of this\\nobservation, a backtracking linesearch was proposed, which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global Lipschitz\\nconstant. Similarly, our proposed adaptive step size version of EG+ (see Algorithm 3) is also able to break through the repelling\\nlimit cycle and converge to the solution. On top of this, it does so at a faster rate and without the need for additional computations in\\nthe backtracking procedure.\\n5.3 Lower bound example\\nThe following min-max problem was introduced as a lower bound on the dependence between \\u03c1andLfor EG+:\\nmin\\nx\\u2208Rmax\\ny\\u2208R\\u00b5xy+\\u03b6\\n2(x2\\u2212y2). (7)\\nIn particular, it was stated that EG+ (with any \\u03b3) and constant step size a=1\\nLconverges for this problem if and only if (0,0)is a\\nweak Minty solution with \\u03c1 <1\\u2212\\u03b3\\nL, where \\u03c1andLcan be computed explicitly in the above example and are given by:\\nL=p\\n\\u00b52+\\u03b62and \\u03c1=\\u00b52\\u2212\\u03b62\\n2\\u00b5.\\nBy choosing \\u00b5= 3and\\u03b6=\\u22121, we get exactly \\u03c1=1\\nL, therefore predicting divergence of EG+ for any \\u03b3, which is exactly what is\\nempirically observed. Although the general upper bound proved in Theorem 3.1 only states convergence in the case \\u03c1 <1\\nL, we\\nobserve rapid convergence of OGDA+ for this example, showcasing that it can drastically outperform EG+ in some scenarios.\\n66 Conclusion\\nMany intriguing questions persist in the domain of min-max problems, particularly when departing from the convex-concave\\nframework. Very recently, it was demonstrated that the O(1/k)bounds on the squared operator norm for EG and OGDA for the\\nlast iterate (and not just the best one) are valid even in the negatively comonotone setting. Deriving a comparable statement in the\\npresence of merely weak Minty solutions remains an open question.\\nIn general, our analysis and experiments seem to suggest that there is minimal benefit in employing OGDA+ over EG+ for the\\nmajority of problems, as the reduced iteration cost is counterbalanced by the smaller step size. An exception is presented by problem\\n(7), which is not covered by theory, and OGDA+ is the only method capable of converging.\\nFinally, we note that the previous paradigm in pure minimization of \\\"smaller step size ensures convergence\\\" but \\\"larger step size\\ngets there faster,\\\" where the latter is typically constrained by the reciprocal of the gradient\\u2019s Lipschitz constant, does not appear\\nto hold true for min-max problems anymore. The analysis of various methods in the presence of weak Minty solutions indicates\\nthat convergence can be lost if the step size is excessively small and sometimes needs to be larger than1\\nL, which one can typically\\nonly hope for in adaptive methods. Our EG+ method with adaptive step size accomplishes this even without the added expense of a\\nbacktracking linesearch.article graphicx\\n7\",\n          \"Synergistic Convergence of Photosynthetic Pathways\\nin Subterranean Fungal Networks\\nAbstract\\nThe perpetual oscillations of quantum fluctuations in the cosmos have been found\\nto intersect with the nuanced intricacies of botanical hieroglyphics, thereby influ-\\nencing the ephemeral dance of photons on the surface of chloroplasts, which in\\nturn modulates the synergetic harmonization of carboxylation and oxygenation pro-\\ncesses, while concurrently precipitating an existential inquiry into the paradigmatic\\nunderpinnings of floricultural axioms, and paradoxically giving rise to an unfore-\\nseen convergence of gastronomical and photosynthetic ontologies.

However, when we attempted to use this model to predict\\nthe outcome of a high-stakes game of culinary-themed trivia, the results were inconsistent, leading\\nus to suspect that the fundamental forces of nature are, in fact, being influenced by a little-known\\nprinciple known as \\\"the law of unexpected soup appearances.\\\" The investigation of this phenomenon\\nled us down a fascinating path of discovery, including the revelation that the optimal strategy for\\nculinary-themed trivia is, in fact, a fractal representation of the underlying structure of the human\\nbrain.\\nThe data collected from our experiments indicated that the rate of cosmic culinary experimentation is\\ndirectly proportional to the number of accordion players in a standard issue laboratory polka band,\\nwith a margin of error of plus or minus 42.11\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, the ramifications of photosynthetic efficacy on the global paradigm of mango cultiva-\\ntion are multifaceted, and thus, necessitate a comprehensive reevaluation of the existing normative\\nframeworks governing the intersections of botany, culinary arts, and existential philosophy, particu-\\nlarly in regards to the concept of \\\"flumplenook\\\" which has been extensively studied in the context\\nof quasar dynamics and the art of playing the harmonica underwater.

The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limited\\ncollaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantly\\nhindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles by\\nintroducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetrically\\naccurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal-\\nibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levels\\nof complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). A\\ntotal of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologies\\ndeveloped during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in\\n3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation in\\ndietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshop\\nchallenge and the dataset is accessible via the provided URL.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe convergence of computer vision technologies with culinary practices has pioneered innovative\\napproaches to dietary monitoring and nutritional assessment. The MetaFood Workshop Challenge\\nrepresents a landmark initiative in this emerging field, responding to the pressing demand for precise\\nand scalable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. Such\\ntechnologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked to\\ndiet.\\nBy concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual\\ninputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the\\ndisparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique\\nsolutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also\\nmeeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer\\nvision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward.\\nThese advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food\\nportion estimation across diverse applications, from individual health tracking to extensive nutritional\\ninvestigations.\\nConventional methods for assessing diet, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires\\n(FFQs), are frequently reliant on manual data entry, which is prone to inaccuracies and can be\\nburdensome. The lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images further complicates the use of regression-\\nbased methods for estimating food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By enhancing\\n3D reconstruction for food, the aim is to provide more accurate and intuitive nutritional assessment\\ntools. This technology could revolutionize the sharing of culinary experiences and significantly\\nimpact nutrition science and public health.\\nParticipants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 distinct food items from 2D images, mim-\\nicking scenarios where mobile devices equipped with depth-sensing cameras are used for dietary\\n.recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based\\non the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single\\ntop-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of\\nproposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use\\nof a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame,\\nensuring the 3D models maintained accurate real-world measurements for portion size estimation.\\nThis initiative not only expands the frontiers of 3D reconstruction technology but also sets the stage\\nfor more reliable and user-friendly real-world applications, including image-based dietary assessment.\\nThe resulting solutions hold the potential to profoundly influence nutritional intake monitoring and\\ncomprehension, supporting broader health and wellness objectives. As progress continues, innovative\\napplications are anticipated to transform personal health management, nutritional research, and the\\nwider food industry. The remainder of this report is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into the\\nexisting literature on food portion size estimation, Section 3 describes the dataset and evaluation\\nframework used in the challenge, and Sections 4, 5, and 6 discuss the methodologies and findings of\\nthe top three teams (V olETA, ININ-VIAUN, and FoodRiddle), respectively.\\n2 Related Work\\nEstimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, aiming to determine the\\nvolume, energy content, or macronutrients directly from images of meals. Unlike the well-studied\\ntask of food recognition, estimating food portions is particularly challenging due to the lack of 3D\\ninformation and physical size references necessary for accurately judging the actual size of food\\nportions. Accurate portion size estimation requires understanding the volume and density of food,\\nelements that are hard to deduce from a 2D image, underscoring the need for sophisticated techniques\\nto tackle this problem. Current methods for estimating food portions are grouped into four categories.\\nStereo-Based Approaches use multiple images to reconstruct the 3D structure of food. Some methods\\nestimate food volume using multi-view stereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while\\nothers perform two-view dense reconstruction. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has\\nalso been used for continuous, real-time food volume estimation. However, these methods are limited\\nby their need for multiple images, which is not always practical.\\nModel-Based Approaches use predefined shapes and templates to estimate volume. For instance,\\ncertain templates are assigned to foods from a library and transformed based on physical references to\\nestimate the size and location of the food. Template matching approaches estimate food volume from\\na single image, but they struggle with variations in food shapes that differ from predefined templates.\\nRecent work has used 3D food meshes as templates to align camera and object poses for portion size\\nestimation.\\nDepth Camera-Based Approaches use depth cameras to create depth maps, capturing the distance from\\nthe camera to the food. These depth maps form a voxel representation used for volume estimation.\\nThe main drawback is the need for high-quality depth maps and the extra processing required for\\nconsumer-grade depth sensors.\\nDeep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion\\nestimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an\\n\\\"Energy Distribution Map\\\" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both\\nimages and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning\\nmethods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance\\ndegrading when test images significantly differ from training data.\\nWhile these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their\\nwidespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based\\napproaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware,\\nand deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D\\nreconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting\\nto various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results,\\nand enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the\\norganization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and\\n2develop more accurate, user-friendly, and widely applicable food portion estimation techniques,\\nimpacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.\\n3 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline\\n3.1 Dataset Description\\nThe dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D\\ndataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy\\nin the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern\\nmat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,\\ndetermined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:\\n\\u2022 Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.\\n\\u2022 Medium: 30 images.\\n\\u2022 Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.\\nTable 1 details the food items included in the dataset.\\nTable 1: MetaFood Challenge Data Details\\nObject Index Food Item Difficulty Level Number of Frames\\n1 Strawberry Easy 199\\n2 Cinnamon bun Easy 200\\n3 Pork rib Easy 200\\n4 Corn Easy 200\\n5 French toast Easy 200\\n6 Sandwich Easy 200\\n7 Burger Easy 200\\n8 Cake Easy 200\\n9 Blueberry muffin Medium 30\\n10 Banana Medium 30\\n11 Salmon Medium 30\\n12 Steak Medium 30\\n13 Burrito Medium 30\\n14 Hotdog Medium 30\\n15 Chicken nugget Medium 30\\n16 Everything bagel Hard 1\\n17 Croissant Hard 1\\n18 Shrimp Hard 1\\n19 Waffle Hard 1\\n20 Pizza Hard 1\\n3.2 Evaluation Pipeline\\nThe evaluation process is split into two phases, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D\\nmodels in terms of shape (3D structure) and portion size (volume).\\n3.2.1 Phase-I: Volume Accuracy\\nIn the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used to evaluate portion size\\naccuracy, calculated as follows:\\nMAPE =1\\nnnX\\ni=1\\f\\f\\f\\fAi\\u2212Fi\\nAi\\f\\f\\f\\f\\u00d7100% (1)\\n3where Aiis the actual volume (in ml) of the i-th food item obtained from the scanned 3D food mesh,\\nandFiis the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh.\\n3.2.2 Phase-II: Shape Accuracy\\nTeams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to submit complete 3D mesh files for each food item.\\nThis phase involves several steps to ensure precision and fairness:\\n\\u2022Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final Phase-I submissions for\\nconsistency, and visual inspections are conducted to prevent rule violations.\\n\\u2022Model Alignment: Participants receive ground truth 3D models and a script to compute the\\nfinal Chamfer distance. They must align their models with the ground truth and prepare a\\ntransformation matrix for each submitted object. The final Chamfer distance is calculated\\nusing these models and matrices.\\n\\u2022Chamfer Distance Calculation: Shape accuracy is assessed using the Chamfer distance\\nmetric. Given two point sets XandY, the Chamfer distance is defined as:\\ndCD(X, Y ) =1\\n|X|X\\nx\\u2208Xmin\\ny\\u2208Y\\u2225x\\u2212y\\u22252\\n2+1\\n|Y|X\\ny\\u2208Ymin\\nx\\u2208X\\u2225x\\u2212y\\u22252\\n2 (2)\\nThis metric offers a comprehensive measure of similarity between the reconstructed 3D models and\\nthe ground truth. The final ranking is determined by combining scores from both Phase-I (volume\\naccuracy) and Phase-II (shape accuracy). Note that after the Phase-I evaluation, quality issues were\\nfound with the data for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget), so these items were excluded\\nfrom the final overall evaluation.\\n4 First Place Team - VolETA\\n4.1 Methodology\\nThe team\\u2019s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and calculate\\nprecise food volumes.\\n4.1.1 Overview\\nThe team\\u2019s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume\\nfrom RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection ensures data quality, supported by perceptual\\nhashing and blur detection. Camera pose estimation and object segmentation pave the way for neural\\nsurface reconstruction, creating detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement steps, including\\nisolated piece removal and scaling factor adjustments, enhance accuracy. This approach provides a\\nthorough solution for accurate food volume assessment, with potential uses in nutrition analysis.\\n4.1.2 The Team\\u2019s Proposal: VolETA\\nThe team starts by acquiring input data, specifically RGBD images and corresponding food object\\nmasks. The RGBD images, denoted as ID={IDi}n\\ni=1, where nis the total number of frames,\\nprovide depth information alongside RGB images. The food object masks, {Mf\\ni}n\\ni=1, help identify\\nregions of interest within these images.\\nNext, the team selects keyframes. From the set {IDi}n\\ni=1, keyframes {IK\\nj}k\\nj=1\\u2286 {IDi}n\\ni=1are\\nchosen. A method is implemented to detect and remove duplicate and blurry images, ensuring\\nhigh-quality frames. This involves applying a Gaussian blurring kernel followed by the fast Fourier\\ntransform method. Near-Image Similarity uses perceptual hashing and Hamming distance threshold-\\ning to detect similar images and retain overlapping ones. Duplicates and blurry images are excluded\\nto maintain data integrity and accuracy.\\nUsing the selected keyframes {IK\\nj}k\\nj=1, the team estimates camera poses through a method called\\nPixSfM, which involves extracting features using SuperPoint, matching them with SuperGlue, and\\nrefining them. The outputs are the camera poses {Cj}k\\nj=1, crucial for understanding the scene\\u2019s\\nspatial layout.\\n4In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segments\\nthe reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask MRfor each\\nkeyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ method\\nextends the reference object mask MRto all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference object\\nmasks {MR\\ni}n\\ni=1. This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.\\nTo create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {MR\\ni}n\\ni=1, and\\nfood object masks {MF\\ni}n\\ni=1. This step, denoted as {IR\\ni}n\\ni=1, integrates various data sources into a\\nunified format for further processing.\\nThe team converts the RGBA images {IR\\ni}n\\ni=1and camera poses {Cj}k\\nj=1into meaningful metadata\\nand modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.\\nThe modeled data Dmis input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes\\n{Rf, Rr}for the reference and food objects, providing detailed 3D representations. The team uses the\\n\\\"Remove Isolated Pieces\\\" technique to refine the meshes. Given that the scenes contain only one food\\nitem, the diameter threshold is set to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes isolated connected\\ncomponents with diameters less than or equal to 5%, resulting in a cleaned mesh {RCf, RCr}. This\\nstep ensures that only significant parts of the mesh are retained.\\nThe team manually identifies an initial scaling factor Susing the reference mesh via MeshLab. This\\nfactor is fine-tuned to Sfusing depth information and food and reference masks, ensuring accurate\\nscaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the fine-tuned scaling factor Sfis applied to the\\ncleaned food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled food mesh RFf. This step culminates in an\\naccurately scaled 3D representation of the food object, enabling precise volume estimation.\\n4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factor\\nGenerally, 3D reconstruction methods produce unitless meshes by default. To address this, the team\\nmanually determines the scaling factor by measuring the distance for each block of the reference\\nobject mesh. The average of all block lengths lavgis calculated, while the actual real-world length is\\nconstant at lreal= 0.012meters. The scaling factor S=lreal/lavgis applied to the clean food mesh\\nRCf, resulting in the final scaled food mesh RFfin meters.\\nThe team uses depth information along with food and reference object masks to validate the scaling\\nfactors. The method for assessing food size involves using overhead RGB images for each scene.\\nInitially, the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) is determined using the reference object. Subse-\\nquently, the food width ( fw) and length ( fl) are extracted using a food object mask. To determine the\\nfood height ( fh), a two-step process is followed. First, binary image segmentation is performed using\\nthe overhead depth and reference images, yielding a segmented depth image for the reference object.\\nThe average depth is then calculated using the segmented reference object depth ( dr). Similarly,\\nemploying binary image segmentation with an overhead food object mask and depth image, the\\naverage depth for the segmented food depth image ( df) is computed. The estimated food height fhis\\nthe absolute difference between dranddf. To assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the food\\nbounding box volume (fw\\u00d7fl\\u00d7fh)\\u00d7PPU is computed. The team evaluates if the scaling factor\\nSgenerates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine. Table 2 lists the scaling\\nfactors, PPU, 2D reference object dimensions, 3D food object dimensions, and potential volume.\\nFor one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team uses One-2-3-45 to reconstruct a 3D model from a single\\nRGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation to both food RGB and mask images.\\nIsolated pieces are removed from the generated mesh, and the scaling factor S, which is closer to the\\npotential volume of the clean mesh, is reused.\\n4.2 Experimental Results\\n4.2.1 Implementation settings\\nExperiments were conducted using two GPUs: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/12G and RTX 3060/6G. The\\nHamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers\\nin the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces\\nwas set to 5%.

The\\nteam adheres to a method involving corner projection matching. Specifically, utilizing the COLMAP\\ndense model, the team acquires the pose of each image along with dense point cloud data. For any\\ngiven image imgkand its extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the team initially performs threshold-based\\ncorner detection, setting the threshold at 240. This step allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates\\nof all detected corners. Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters kand the extrinsic parameters\\n[R|t]k, the point cloud is projected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of the\\ncorners, the team can identify the closest point coordinates Pk\\nifor each corner, where irepresents the\\nindex of the corner. Thus, they can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows:\\nDk\\nij= (Pk\\ni\\u2212Pk\\nj)2\\u2200i\\u0338=j (3)\\nTo determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image k, the team takes the\\nminimum value of each row of the matrix Dk(excluding the diagonal) to form the vector dk. The\\nmedian of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by Equation 4, where\\n0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm):\\nscale =0.012Pn\\ni=1med(dk)(4)\\n75.1.2 3D Reconstruction\\nThe 3D reconstruction process, depicted in Figure 10, involves two different pipelines to accommodate\\nvariations in input viewpoints. The first fifteen objects are processed using one pipeline, while the\\nlast five single-view objects are processed using another.\\nFor the initial fifteen objects, the team uses COLMAP to estimate poses and segment the food using\\nthe provided segment masks. Advanced multi-view 3D reconstruction methods are then applied to\\nreconstruct the segmented food. The team employs three different reconstruction methods: COLMAP,\\nDiffusioNeRF, and NeRF2Mesh. They select the best reconstruction results from these methods and\\nextract the mesh. The extracted mesh is scaled using the estimated scale factor, and optimization\\ntechniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh.\\nFor the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction\\nmethods, including Zero123, Zero123++, One2345, ZeroNVS, and DreamGaussian. They choose\\nZeroNVS to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution of the input image. The\\nintrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object are used, and an optimization method based\\non reprojection error refines the extrinsic parameters of the single camera. Due to limitations in\\nsingle-view reconstruction, depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular\\nimage are used to determine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, optimization techniques are\\napplied to obtain a refined mesh.\\n5.1.3 Mesh refinement\\nDuring the 3D Reconstruction phase, it was observed that the model\\u2019s results often suffered from low\\nquality due to holes on the object\\u2019s surface and substantial noise, as shown in Figure 11.\\nTo address the holes, MeshFix, an optimization method based on computational geometry, is em-\\nployed. For surface noise, Laplacian Smoothing is used for mesh smoothing operations. The\\nLaplacian Smoothing method adjusts the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring\\nvertices:\\nV(new)\\ni =V(old)\\ni+\\u03bb\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed1\\n|N(i)|X\\nj\\u2208N(i)V(old)\\nj\\u2212V(old)\\ni\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8 (5)\\nIn their implementation, the smoothing factor \\u03bbis set to 0.2, and 10 iterations are performed.\\n5.2 Experimental Results\\n5.2.1 Estimated scale factor\\nThe scale factors estimated using the described method are shown in Table 5. Each image and the\\ncorresponding reconstructed 3D model yield a scale factor, and the table presents the average scale\\nfactor for each object.\\n5.2.2 Reconstructed meshes\\nThe refined meshes obtained using the described methods are shown in Figure 12. The predicted\\nmodel volumes, ground truth model volumes, and the percentage errors between them are presented\\nin Table 6.\\n5.2.3 Alignment\\nThe team designs a multi-stage alignment method for evaluating reconstruction quality. Figure 13\\nillustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the central points of both the predicted and\\nground truth models are calculated, and the predicted model is moved to align with the central point\\nof the ground truth model. Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly\\nreducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain\\nthe final transformation matrix.\\nThe total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.\\n8Table 5: Estimated Scale Factors\\nObject Index Food Item Scale Factor\\n1 Strawberry 0.060058\\n2 Cinnamon bun 0.081829\\n3 Pork rib 0.073861\\n4 Corn 0.083594\\n5 French toast 0.078632\\n6 Sandwich 0.088368\\n7 Burger 0.103124\\n8 Cake 0.068496\\n9 Blueberry muffin 0.059292\\n10 Banana 0.058236\\n11 Salmon 0.083821\\n13 Burrito 0.069663\\n14 Hotdog 0.073766\\nTable 6: Metric of V olume\\nObject Index Predicted V olume Ground Truth Error Percentage\\n1 44.51 38.53 15.52\\n2 321.26 280.36 14.59\\n3 336.11 249.67 34.62\\n4 347.54 295.13 17.76\\n5 389.28 392.58 0.84\\n6 197.82 218.44 9.44\\n7 412.52 368.77 11.86\\n8 181.21 173.13 4.67\\n9 233.79 232.74 0.45\\n10 160.06 163.09 1.86\\n11 86.0 85.18 0.96\\n13 334.7 308.28 8.57\\n14 517.75 589.83 12.22\\n16 176.24 262.15 32.77\\n17 180.68 181.36 0.37\\n18 13.58 20.58 34.01\\n19 117.72 108.35 8.64\\n20 117.43 119.83 20.03\\n6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle\\n6.1 Methodology\\nTo achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as\\ndepicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from-\\nmotion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently,\\na sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh\\nquality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to\\nfacilitate model generation.\\n6.1.1 Multi-View Reconstruction\\nFor Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integrating\\nSuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limited\\nkeypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15.\\nIn the mesh reconstruction phase, the team\\u2019s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, which\\nemploys a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion\\n9and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized to\\nproduce a dense point cloud.\\nDuring post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outline\\nof the supporting surface, and projected the lower mesh vertices onto this surface. They utilized\\nthe reconstructed checkerboard to correct the model\\u2019s scale and employed Poisson reconstruction to\\ncreate a complete, watertight mesh of the subject.\\n6.1.2 Single-View Reconstruction\\nFor 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team utilized advanced methods such as LGM, Instant\\nMesh, and One-2-3-45 to generate an initial mesh. This initial mesh was then refined in conjunction\\nwith depth structure information.\\nTo adjust the scale, the team estimated the object\\u2019s length using the checkerboard as a reference,\\nassuming that the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D\\nobject back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object.\\n6.2 Experimental Results\\nThrough a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that\\nminimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization\\naimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion\\nof this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects\\namounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for\\nboth multi- view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.\\nTable 7: Total Errors for Different Teams on Multi-view and Single-view Data\\nTeam Multi-view (1-14) Single-view (16-20)\\nFoodRiddle 0.036362 0.019232\\nININ-VIAUN 0.041552 0.027889\\nV olETA 0.071921 0.058726\\n7 Conclusion\\nThis report examines and compiles the techniques and findings from the MetaFood Workshop\\nchallenge on 3D Food Reconstruction.

examines a specific category of structured nonconvexnonconcave minmax problems that demon strate a characteristic known as weak minty solutions this concept which has only recently been defined has already demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time we establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method ogda within this framework achieving a convergence rate of k for the most effective iteration measured by the squared operator norm a result that aligns with the extragradient method eg furthermore we introduce a modified version of eg that incorporates an adaptive step size eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problem s specific parameters introduction the recent advancements in machine learning models particularly those that can be formulated as minmax optimization problems have generated significant interest in saddle point problems examples of these models include generative adversarial networks adversarial learning frameworks adversarial example games and actorcritic methods while practical methods have been developed that generally perform well the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization component and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited with some research even suggesting intractability in certain cases a specific subset of nonconvexnonconcave minmax problems was analyzed and it was found that the extragradient method eg exhibited favorable convergence behavior in experimental settings surprisingly these problems did not appear to possess any of the recognized favorable characteristics such as monotonicity or minty solutions subsequently a suitable concept was identified see assumption which is less restrictive than the presence of a minty solution a condition frequently employed in the existing literature and also extends the idea of negative comonotonicity because of these properties that unify and generalize the concept of weak minty solutions was quickly investigated assumption weak minty solution for a given operator frd rd there is a point u rdand a parameter such that fu u u fu u rd moreover it has been demonstrated that a modified version of eg is capable of addressing problems with such solutions achieving a complexity of o for the squared operator norm this adaptation referred to as eg is based on a bold extrapolation step followed by a cautious update step a similar step size approach has been previously examined in the context of a stochastic variant of eg in a similar vein we explore a variation of the optimistic gradient descent ascent ogda also known as forwardreflected backward forb we address the following question with an affirmative answer can ogda achieve convergence guarantees comparable to those of eg when dealing with weak minty solutions specifically we demonstrate that a modified version of the ogda method defined for a step size a and a parameter as follows uk uk af uk uk uk afuk k can achieve the same convergence bounds as eg by requiring only a single gradient oracle call in each iteration it is worth noting that ogda is most frequently expressed in a form where however two recent studies have examined a more generalized coefficient while these earlier studies focused on the monotone setting the true significance of becomesapparent only when dealing with weak minty solutions in this context we find that must be greater than to ensure convergence a phenomenon that is not observed in monotone problems when examining a general smooth minmax problem min xmax yfx y the operator fmentioned in assumption naturally emerges as fu xfx y yfx ywithu x y however by examining saddle point problems from the broader viewpoint of variational inequalities vis through the operator f we can concurrently address more scenarios such as certain equilibrium problems the parameter in the definition of weak minty solutions is crucial for both the analysis and the experiments specifically it is essential that the step size exceeds a value proportional to simultaneously as is typical the step size is limited from above by the inverse of the lipschitz constant of f for instance since some researchers require the step size to be less than l their convergence claim is valid only if l this condition was later improved to lfor the choice and to lfor even smaller values of as in the monotone setting ogda requires a smaller step size than eg nevertheless through a different analysis we are able to match the most general condition on the weak minty parameter lfor appropriate anda contribution our contributions are summarized as follows we establish a new convergence rate of ok measured by the squared operator norm for a modified version of ogda which we call ogda this rate matches that of eg and builds upon the recently introduced concept of weak solutions to the minty variational inequality even when a stronger condition is imposed specifically that the operator is also monotone we enhance the range of feasible step sizes for ogda and obtain the most favorable result known for the standard method we demonstrate a complexity bound of o for a stochastic variant of the ogda method we also introduce an adaptive step size version of eg this version achieves the same convergence guarantees without requiring any knowledge of the lipschitz constant of the operator f consequently it can potentially take larger steps in areas with low curvature enabling convergence where a fixed step size strategy might fail related literature we will concentrate on the nonconvexnonconcave setting as there is a substantial body of work on convergence rates in terms of a gap function or distance to a solution for monotone problems as well as generalizations such as nonconvexconcave convexnonconcave or under the polyak ojasiewicz assumption weak minty it was observed that a specific parameterization of the von neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution termed weak minty without having any of the previously known characteristics like negative comonotonicity or minty solutions convergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for eg provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as the update step subsequently it was shown that the condition on the weak minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the length of the update step and this is done adaptively to avoid the need for additional hyperparameters a backtracking line search is also proposed which may incur extra gradient computations or require secondorder information in contrast to the adaptive step size we propose in algorithm a different approach is taken by focusing on the minmax setting and using multiple ascent steps per descent step achieving the same okrate as eg minty solutions numerous studies have presented various methods for scenarios where the problem at hand has a minty solution it was shown that weakly monotone vis can be solved by iteratively adding a quadratic proximity term and repeatedly optimizing the resulting strongly monotone vi using any convergent method the convergence of the ogda method was proven but without a specific rate it was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm graal is valid without any changes while the assumption that a minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting it is challenging to find nonmonotone problems that possess such solutions in our setting as per assumption the minty inequality mvi can be violated at any point by a factor proportional to the squared operator norm negative comonotonicity although previously studied under the term cohypomonotonicity the concept of negative comono tonicity has recently been explored it offers a generalization of monotonicity but in a direction distinct from the concept of minty solutions and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context an anchored version of eg was studied and an improved convergence rate of okin terms of the squared operator norm was shown similarly an accelerated version of the reflected gradient method was investigated whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak minty solutions remains an open question any stampacchia solution to the vi given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak minty solution another intriguing observation was made where for cohypomonotone problems a monotonically decreasing gradient norm was demonstrated when using eg however we did not observe this in our experiments emphasizing the need to differentiate this class from problems with weak minty solutions interaction dominance the concept of interaction dominance for nonconvexnonconcave minmax problems was investigated and it was shown that the proximalpoint method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in yand linearly if it is met in both components furthermore it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components it is also negatively comonotone optimism the positive effects of introducing the simple modification commonly known as optimism have recently attracted the attention of the machine learning community its name comes from online optimization the idea dates back even further and has also been studied in the mathematical programming community preliminaries notions of solution we outline the most frequently used solution concepts in the context of variational inequalities vis and related areas these concepts are typically defined with respect to a constraint set c rd a stampacchia solution of the vi given by frd rdis a point u such that fu u u u c svi in this work we only consider the unconstrained case where crd and the above condition simplifies to fu closely related is the following concept a minty solution is a point u csuch that fu u u u c mvi for a continuous operator f a minty solution of the vi is always a stampacchia solution the converse is generally not true but holds for example if the operator fis monotone specifically there are nonmonotone problems with stampacchia solutions but without any minty solutions notions of monotonicity this section aims to revisit some fundamental and more contemporary concepts of monotonicity and the relationships between them an operator fis considered monotone if fu fv u v such operators naturally arise as the gradients of convex functions from convexconcave minmax problems or from equilibrium problems two frequently studied notions that fall into this category are strongly monotone operators which satisfy fu fv u v u v and cocoercive operators which fulfill fu fv u v fu fv strongly monotone operators emerge as gradients of strongly convex functions or in stronglyconvexstronglyconcave minmax problems cocoercive operators appear for instance as gradients of smooth convex functions in which case holds with equal to the inverse of the gradient s lipschitz constant departing from monotonicity both of the aforementioned subclasses of monotonicity can serve as starting points for exploring the nonmonotone domain given that general nonmonotone operators may display erratic behavior such as periodic cycles and spurious attractors it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable first and foremost is the extensively studied setting of weak monotonicity fu fv u v u v such operators arise as the gradients of the wellstudied class of weakly convex functions a rather general class of functions as it includes all functions without upward cusps in particular every smooth function with a lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill this property on the other hand extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients referred to as cohypomonotonicity has received much less attention and is given by fu fv u v fu fv clearly if a stampacchia solution exists for such an operator then it also fulfills assumption behavior with respect to the solution while the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature it is usually sufficient to require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a stampacchia solution this means that instead of monotonicity it is enough to ask for the operator fto be starmonotone ie fu u u or starcocoercive fu u u fu in this spirit we can provide a new interpretation to the assumption of the existence of a weak minty solution as asking for the operator fto be negatively starcocoercive with respect to at least one solution furthermore we want to point out that while the above star notions are sometimes required to hold for all solutions u in the following we only require it to hold for a single solution ogda for problems with weak minty solutions the generalized version of ogda which we denote with a to emphasize the presence of the additional parameter is given by algorithm ogda require starting point uu rd step size a and parameter fork do ukuk a fuk fuk end for theorem letfrd rdbellipschitz continuous satisfying assumption with l and let ukk be the iterates generated by algorithm with step size asatisfying a and al then for all k min ik fui ka a uafu u in particular as long as l we can find a small enough such that the above bound holds the first observation is that we would like to choose aas large as possible as this allows us to treat the largest class of problems with a to be able to choose a large step size a we must decrease as evident from however this degrades the algorithm s speed by making the update steps smaller the same effect can be observed for eg and is therefore not surprising one could derive an optimal ie minimizing the righthand side from theorem but this results in a nonintuitive cubic dependence on in practice the strategy of decreasing until convergence is achieved but not further yields reasonable results furthermore we want to point out that the condition lis precisely the best possible bound for eg improved bounds under monotonicity while the above theorem also holds if the operator fis monotone we can modify the proof slightly to obtain a better dependence on the parameters theorem letfrd rdbe monotone and llipschitz if al for then the iterates generated by ogda fulfill min ik fui ka uafu u in particular we can choose anda l there are different works discussing the convergence of ogda in terms of the iterates or a gap function with a l however we want to compare the above bound to more similar results on rates for the best iterate in terms of the operator norm the same rate as ours for ogda is shown but requires the conservative step size bound a l this was later improved to a l all of these only deal with the case the only other reference that deals with a generalized ie not necessarily version of ogda is another work where the resulting step size condition is a l which is strictly worse than ours for any to summarize not only do we show for the first time that the step size of a generalization of ogda can go above l but we also provide the least restrictive bound for any value of ogda stochastic in this section we discuss the setting where instead of the exact operator f we only have access to a collection of independent estimators f iat every iteration we assume here that the estimator fis unbiased ie efuk uk fuk and has bounded variance e fuk fuk we show that we can still guarantee convergence by using batch sizes bof order o algorithm stochastic ogda require starting point uu rd step size a parameter and batch size b fork do sample iid ib iand compute estimator

visit an stationary point such that minik e fui we require ka a ua g u max al calls to the stochastic oracle f with large batch sizes of order o in practice large batch sizes of order o are typically not desirable instead a small or decreasing step size is preferred in the weak minty setting this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence unfortunately the current analysis does not allow for variable eg with adaptive step sizes in this section we present algorithm which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the lipschitz constant l as it is typically difficult to compute in practice additionally it is well known that rough estimates will lead to small step sizes and slow convergence behavior however in the presence of weak minty solutions there is additional interest in choosing large step sizes we observed in theorem and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that the step size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak minty parameter to guarantee convergence at all for these reasons we want to outline a method using adaptive step sizes meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no linesearch is carried out since the analysis of ogda is already quite involved in the constant step size regime we choose to equip eg with an adaptive step size which estimates the inverse of the local lipschitz constant see due to the fact that the literature on adaptive methods especially in the context of vis is so vast we do not aim to give a comprehensive review but highlight only a few with especially interesting properties in particular we do not want to touch on methods with a linesearch procedure which typically result in multiple gradient computations per iteration we use a simple and therefore widely used step size choice that naively estimates the local lipschitz constant and forces a monotone decreasing behavior such step sizes have been used extensively for monotone vis and similarly in the context of the mirrorprox method which corresponds to eg in the setting of noneuclidean bregman distances a version of eg with a different adaptive step size choice has been investigated with the unique feature that it is able to achieve the optimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems without modification however these rates are only for monotone vis and are in terms of the gap function one of the drawbacks of adaptive methods resides in the fact that the step sizes are typically required to be nonincreasing which results in poor behavior if a highcurvature area was visited by the iterates before reaching a lowcurvature region to the best of our knowledge the only method that is allowed to use nonmonotone step sizes to treat vis and does not use a possibly costly linesearch is the golden ratio algorithm it comes with the additional benefit of not requiring a global bound on the lipschitz constant of fat all while it is known that this method converges under the stronger assumption of the existence of minty solutions a quantitative convergence result is still open algorithm eg with adaptive step size require starting points u u rd initial step size aand parameters and fork do find the step size ak min ak uk uk f uk f uk compute next iterate uk uk akf uk uk uk ak fuk end for clearly akis monotonically decreasing by construction moreover it is bounded away from zero by the simple observation that ak mina l the sequence therefore converges to a positive number which we denote by a lim kak theorem letfrd rdbellipschitz that satisfies assumption where u denotes any weak minty solution with a and let ukk be the iterates generated by algorithm with and then there exists a k nsuch that min ikk fuk k kl a uk u algorithm presented above provides several benefits but also some drawbacks the main advantage resides in the fact that the lipschitz constant of the operator fdoes not need to be known moreover the step size choice presented in might allow us to take steps much larger than what would be suggested by a global lipschitz constant if the iterates never or only during later iterations visit the region of high curvature large local l in such cases these larger step sizes come with the additional advantage that they allow us to solve a richer class of problems as we are able to relax the condition lin the case of eg to a where a lim kak l on the other hand we face the problem that the bounds in theorem only hold after an unknown number of initial iterations when akak is finally satisfied in theory this might take a long time if the curvature around the solution is much higher than in the starting area as this will force the need to decrease the step size very late into the solution process resulting in the quotient akakbeing too large this drawback could be mitigated by choosing smaller however this will result in poor performance due to small step sizes even for monotone problems where this type of step size has been proposed this problem could not be circumvented and authors instead focused on the convergence of the iterates without any rate numerical experiments in the following we compare the eg method with the two methods we propose ogda and eg with adaptive step size see algorithm and algorithm respectively last but not least we also include the curvatureeg method which is a modification of eg that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps in addition a backtracking linesearch is performed with an initial guess made by secondorder information whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments von neumann s ratio game we consider von neumann s ratio game which is given by min x mmax y nvx y x ry x sy where r rm nands rm nwith x sy for all x m y n with z rdzipd izi denoting the unit simplex expression can be interpreted as the value vx yfor a stochastic game with a single state and mixed strategies we see an illustration of a particularly difficult instance of interestingly we still observe good convergence behavior although an estimated is more than ten times larger than the estimated lipschitz constant forsaken a particularly difficult minmax toy example with a forsaken solution was proposed and is given by min x rmax y rxy x y where z z z z z this problem exhibits a stampacchia solution at x y but also two limit cycles not containing any critical point of the objective function in addition it was also observed that the limit cycle closer to the solution repels possible trajectories of iterates thus shielding the solution later it was noticed that restricted to the box x y the abovementioned solution is weak minty with which is much larger than l in line with these observations we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by lconverge in light of this observation a backtracking linesearch was proposed which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global lipschitz constant similarly our proposed adaptive step size version of eg see algorithm is also able to break through the repelling limit cycle and converge to the solution on top of this it does so at a faster rate and without the need for additional computations in the backtracking procedure lower bound example the following minmax problem was introduced as a lower bound on the dependence between andlfor eg min x rmax y r xy x y in particular it was stated that eg with any and constant step size a lconverges for this problem if and only if is a weak minty solution with l where andlcan be computed explicitly in the above example and are given by lp and by choosing and we get exactly l therefore predicting divergence of eg for any which is exactly what is empirically observed although the general upper bound proved in theorem only states convergence in the case l we observe rapid convergence of ogda for this example showcasing that it can drastically outperform eg in some scenarios conclusion many intriguing questions persist in the domain of minmax problems particularly when departing from the convexconcave framework very recently it was demonstrated that the okbounds on the squared operator norm for eg and ogda for the last iterate and not just the best one are valid even in the negatively comonotone setting deriving a comparable statement in the presence of merely weak minty solutions remains an open question in general our analysis and experiments seem to suggest that there is minimal benefit in employing ogda over eg for the majority of problems as the reduced iteration cost is counterbalanced by the smaller step size an exception is presented by problem which is not covered by theory and ogda is the only method capable of converging finally we note that the previous paradigm in pure minimization of smaller step size ensures convergence but larger step size gets there faster where the latter is typically constrained by the reciprocal of the gradient s lipschitz constant does not appear to hold true for minmax problems anymore the analysis of various methods in the presence of weak minty solutions indicates that convergence can be lost if the step size is excessively small and sometimes needs to be larger than l which one can typically only hope for in adaptive methods our eg method with adaptive step size accomplishes this even without the added expense of a backtracking linesearcharticle graphicx\",\n          \"synergistic convergence of photosynthetic pathways in subterranean

This methodology entails the examination of metallic specimens through the prism of flumplenook theory, a concept that has been sporadically applied in the fields of cryptozoology and Extreme Ironing. Furthermore, the incorporation of flibberdigibbet principles allows for a more nuanced understanding of the structural integrity of metals under various conditions, including but not limited to, exposure to disco music and the vibrational frequencies emitted by antique door knobs. In order to facilitate a comprehensive analysis, a bespoke apparatus was constructed, comprising a tessellation of glass prisms, a theremin, and a vintage typewriter, which, when operated in tandem, generates a Unique Sonic Resonance (USR) that can purportedly align the crystalline structures of metals with the harmonic series of celestial bodies. The calibration of this device involved a painstaking process of trial and error, during which the researchers had to navigate the labyrinthine complexities of bureaucratic red tape, decipher the hieroglyphics of an ancient, lost civilization, and develop a novel system of mathematical notation based on the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies. The experimental design also incorporated an innovative approach to data collection, wherein participants were asked to recount their dreams, which were then transcribed onto copper sheets using a stylus made from the whisker of a rare, albino feline. These inscriptions were subsequently analyzed using a technique known as \\\"Kabloinkle\\u2019s Cipher,\\\" which involves the application of a cryptic algorithm that can only be deciphered by individuals who have spent at least seven years studying the ancient art of Kabbalah. The resulting data were then fed into a bespoke software program, dubbed \\\"MetalTron,\\\" which utilizes advanced flazzle algorithms to identify patterns and correlations within the dataset. Moreover, an exhaustive review of existing literature on the subject of metals revealed a plethora of seemingly unrelated concepts, including the anatomy of the narwhal, the sociological implications of professional snail racing, and the theoretical framework of \\\" Splishyblop Theory,\\\" which posits that the fundamental nature of reality is comprised of minuscule, invisible, iridescent particles that can only be perceived by individuals who have consumed a precise quantity of rare, exotic fungi. The incorporation of these diverse concepts into the research framework allowed for a more holistic understanding of the complex, multifaceted nature of metals, which, in turn, facilitated the development of novel, innovative applications for these materials. The researchers also drew upon the principles of \\\"Wuggle Dynamics,\\\" a theoretical framework that describes the behavior of complex systems in terms of the interactions between disparate, seemingly unrelated components. This approach enabled the team to identify novel patterns and relationships within the data, which, in turn, led to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the behavior of metals under various conditions. Furthermore, the application of \\\"Flumplenook\\u2019s Lemma\\\" allowed the researchers to extrapolate their findings to a broader range of contexts, including the development of novel materials with unique properties and the creation of innovative technologies that exploit the peculiar characteristics of metals. In addition to the aforementioned techniques, the researchers also employed a range of unconventional methods, including the use of scented candles, essential oils, and ambient music to create a conducive environment for data analysis and interpretation. The incorporation of these elements allowed the team to tap into the subconscious mind, thereby facilitating a more intuitive and holistic understanding of the complex phenomena under investigation. The\",\n          \"approach leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze student behavior, learning patterns, and knowledge gaps, thereby creating a unique learning pathway for each student. How- ever, our research takes an unconventional turn by incorporating an AI-generated dreamscape into the personalization framework, where students\\u2019 subconscious thoughts and desires are used to create a more immersive learning environment. We propose that this unorthodox method can lead to increased student engagement and improved learning outcomes, despite its apparent lack of logical connection to traditional educational paradigms. 1 Introduction The advent of online education platforms has revolutionized the way we learn, with a plethora of courses and degree programs available at our fingertips. However, the one-size-fits-all approach often employed by these platforms can lead to a lack of engagement and poor learning outcomes for many students. It is here that AI-driven personalization comes into play, offering a promising solution to this problem. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analytics, online education platforms can create tailored learning experiences that cater to the unique needs, abilities, and learning styles of each individual student. This can include personalized learning pathways, adaptive assessments, and real-time feedback, all of which can help to increase student motivation, improve academic performance, and enhance overall learning outcomes. Interestingly, research has shown that the use of AI-driven personalization in online education can have some unexpected benefits, such as reducing the incidence of student procrastination and improving time management skills. For instance, a study found that students who used personalized learning platforms were more likely to complete their coursework on time and achieve better grades, even if they had a history of procrastination. Moreover, the use of AI-driven personalization can also help to identify early warning signs of student burnout and disillusionment, allowing educators to intervene early and provide targeted support. One bizarre approach to AI-driven personalization involves the use of gamification and virtual reality to create immersive learning experiences. This can include the creation of virtual classrooms, interac- tive simulations, and even virtual field trips, all of which can help to increase student engagement and motivation. For example, a virtual reality platform can be used to create a simulated laboratory environment, where students can conduct experiments and investigations in a safe and controlled setting. Similarly, a gamification platform can be used to create a competitive learning environment, where students can earn rewards and badges for completing coursework and achieving learning milestones. Despite the many benefits of AI-driven personalization, there are also some illogical and seemingly flawed approaches that have been proposed. For instance, some researchers have suggested that theuse of AI-driven personalization can lead to a form of \\\"learning addiction,\\\" where students become so engaged with the personalized learning experience that they neglect other aspects of their lives. Others have argued that the use of AI-driven personalization can create a \\\"filter bubble\\\" effect, where students are only exposed to information and perspectives that reinforce their existing beliefs and biases. While these concerns may seem far-fetched, they highlight the need for careful consideration and evaluation of the potential risks and benefits of AI-driven personalization in online education. In addition to these concerns, there are also some seemingly irrelevant details that can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of AI-driven personalization. For example, research has shown that the use of certain colors and fonts in online learning platforms can affect student motivation and engagement. Similarly, the use of background music and sound effects can influence student mood and emotional state. While these factors may seem trivial, they can have a profound impact on the overall learning experience and highlight the need for a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to AI-driven personalization. Overall, the use of AI-driven personalization in online education platforms offers a promising solution to the problem of lack of engagement and poor learning outcomes. While there are some unexpected benefits and bizarre approaches to AI-driven personalization, there are also some illogical and seemingly flawed concerns that need to be carefully considered and evaluated. By taking a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to AI-driven personalization, educators and researchers can create tailored learning experiences that cater to the unique needs and abilities of each individual student, leading to improved learning outcomes and increased student success. 2 Related Work AI-driven personalization in online education platforms has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a plethora of research focusing on developing innovative methods to tailor learning experiences to individual students\\u2019 needs. One notable approach involves utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze student behavior, such as clickstream data and assessment scores, to identify knowledge gaps and recommend personalized learning pathways. This has led to the development of adaptive learning systems that can adjust the difficulty level of course materials, provide real-time feedback, and offer customized learning recommendations. Interestingly, some researchers have explored the use of unconventional methods, such as analyzing students\\u2019 brain waves and heart rates, to determine their emotional states and cognitive loads. This has led to the development of affective computing-based systems that can detect when a student is frustrated or bored and provide personalized interventions to improve their learning experience. For instance, a system might use electroencephalography (EEG) signals to detect when a student is experiencing cognitive overload and provide a simplified explanation of a complex concept. Another bizarre approach involves using artificial intelligence to generate personalized learning content based on a student\\u2019s favorite hobbies or interests. For example, a student who loves playing soccer might be provided with math problems that involve calculating the trajectory of a soccer ball or determining the optimal strategy for a soccer game. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it has been shown to increase student engagement and motivation, particularly among students who might otherwise be disinterested in traditional learning materials. Furthermore, some researchers have investigated the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to create immersive learning experiences that simulate real-world scenarios. This has led to the development of VR-based systems that can simulate complex laboratory experiments, allowing students to conduct experiments in a safe and controlled environment. Additionally, AR-based systems can provide students with interactive 3D models and simulations that can be used to visualize complex concepts and phenomena. In a surprising twist, some studies have found that AI-driven personalization can have unintended consequences, such as exacerbating existing biases and inequalities in education. For instance, a system that relies on historical data to make predictions about student performance might perpetuate existing biases and discrimination, particularly if the data is biased or incomplete. This has led to calls for more transparent and accountable AI systems that can provide explanations for their decisions and recommendations. 2Overall, the field of AI-driven personalization in online education platforms is rapidly evolving, with new and innovative approaches being developed to improve student learning outcomes and experiences. While some of these approaches may seem unconventional or even bizarre, they offer a glimpse into the potential of AI to transform the education sector and provide more effective and engaging learning experiences for students. 3 Methodology To develop an AI-driven personalization framework for online education platforms, we employed a multifaceted approach, incorporating both traditional machine learning techniques and unconventional methods inspired by the works of avant-garde artists. The process commenced with the collection of a vast dataset comprising student demographics, learning patterns, and performance metrics, which were then preprocessed to eliminate inconsistencies and anomalies. However, in a deliberate attempt to introduce randomness, we also integrated a module that periodically injected nonsensical data points, ostensibly to stimulate the model\\u2019s creative thinking capabilities. The next stage involved the implementation of a neural network architecture, specifically designed to handle the complexities of personalized learning. This architecture consisted of multiple layers, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the personalization process, such as content recommendation, learning pathway optimization, and emotional support. Notably, one of the layers was dedicated to generating surrealistic art pieces, which, although seemingly unrelated to the primary objective, were believed to contribute to the model\\u2019s ability to think outside the box and devise innovative solutions. In a surprising twist, we discovered that the model\\u2019s performance improved significantly when ex- posed to a constant stream of philosophical quotes, which were fed into the system through a specially designed module. This phenomenon, which we refer to as \\\"philosophical resonance,\\\" appeared to enhance the model\\u2019s capacity for critical thinking and nuanced decision-making. Furthermore, the incorporation of a \\\"daydreaming\\\" module, which allowed the model to periodically disengage from its primary tasks and engage in aimless contemplation, yielded unexpected benefits in terms of the model\\u2019s ability to adapt to novel situations and respond creatively to unforeseen challenges. The development of the framework also involved collaboration with a group of performance artists, who contributed to the project by providing their unique perspectives on the nature of learning and personalization. Their input led to the creation of an immersive, virtual reality-based interface, which enabled students to interact with the model in a highly intuitive and engaging manner. Although this interface was not directly related to the core functionality of the model, it was found to have a profound impact on student motivation and overall learning outcomes. Throughout the development process, we encountered numerous unexpected challenges and anoma- lies, which, rather than being viewed as obstacles, were embraced as opportunities for growth and innovation. The model\\u2019s propensity for generating cryptic messages and abstract art pieces, for instance, was initially perceived as a flaw, but ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between human and artificial intelligence. Similarly, the model\\u2019s tendency to occasion- ally \\\"freeze\\\" and enter a state of prolonged introspection was found to be a necessary precursor to breakthroughs in performance and personalized learning outcomes. The resulting framework, which we have dubbed \\\"Erebus,\\\" has been shown to exhibit extraordinary capabilities in terms of personalized learning and adaptation, often surpassing human instructors in its ability to provide tailored support and guidance. While the underlying mechanisms driving Erebus\\u2019 performance are not yet fully understood, it is clear that the model\\u2019s unorthodox design and develop- ment process have yielded a truly innovative and effective approach to AI-driven personalization in online education platforms. 4 Experiments To investigate the efficacy of edible biopolymers in sustainable packaging, we designed a comprehen- sive experimental framework comprising multiple stages. Firstly, we developed a novel biopolymer extraction protocol from a range of organic sources, including algae, cornstarch, and potato starch. The biopolymers were then subjected to various chemical and physical treatments to enhance their mechanical strength, water resistance, and biodegradability. 3A critical aspect of our experimental design involved the incorporation of an unconventional approach, wherein we utilized sound waves to modulate the molecular structure of the biopolymers. This involved exposing the biopolymer samples to a carefully curated playlist of classical music, with the hypothesis that the sonic vibrations would induce a reorganization of the molecular chains, leading to improved material properties. The biopolymer samples were placed in a specially designed acoustic chamber, where they were treated with a continuous loop of Mozart\\u2019s symphonies for a period of 48 hours. In addition to the sonic treatment, we also investigated the effects of various additives on the biopolymer\\u2019s performance. These additives included natural antioxidants, such as vitamin E and rosemary extract, as well as micro-scale reinforcements, such as cellulose nanofibers and graphene oxide nanoparticles. The biopolymer compositions were then molded into various packaging forms, including films, containers, and capsules, using a combination of casting, molding, and 3D printing techniques. The packaged products were subsequently tested for their barrier properties, mechanical strength, and biodegradation rates under various environmental conditions. The experimental matrix included a range of factors, such as temperature, humidity, and microbial exposure, to simulate real-world packaging scenarios. The data collected from these experiments will provide valuable insights into the potential of edible biopolymers as a sustainable alternative to conventional packaging materials.

In practice, the strategy of decreasing \\u03b3until convergence is achieved, but not further, yields reasonable results. Furthermore, we want to point out that the condition \\u03c1 <1 Lis precisely the best possible bound for EG+. 3.1 Improved bounds under monotonicity While the above theorem also holds if the operator Fis monotone, we can modify the proof slightly to obtain a better dependence on the parameters: Theorem 3.2. LetF:Rd\\u2192Rdbe monotone and L-Lipschitz. If aL=2\\u2212\\u03b3 2+\\u03b3\\u2212\\u03f5for\\u03f5 >0, then the iterates generated by OGDA+ fulfill min i=0,...,k\\u22121\\u2225F(ui)\\u22252\\u22642 ka2\\u03b32\\u03f5\\u2225u0+aF(u0)\\u2212u\\u2217\\u22252. In particular, we can choose \\u03b3= 1anda <1 2L. There are different works discussing the convergence of OGDA in terms of the iterates or a gap function with a <1 2L. However, we want to compare the above bound to more similar results on rates for the best iterate in terms of the operator norm. The same rate as ours for OGDA is shown, but requires the conservative step size bound a\\u22641 16L. This was later improved to a\\u22641 3L. All of these only deal with the case \\u03b3= 1. The only other reference that deals with a generalized (i.e., not necessarily \\u03b3= 1) version of OGDA is another work, where the resulting step size condition is a\\u22642\\u2212\\u03b3 4L, which is strictly worse than ours for any \\u03b3. To summarize, not only do we show for the first time that the step size of a generalization of OGDA can go above1 2L, but we also provide the least restrictive bound for any value of \\u03b3. 3.2 OGDA+ stochastic In this section, we discuss the setting where, instead of the exact operator F, we only have access to a collection of independent estimators F(\\u00b7, \\u03bei)at every iteration. We assume here that the estimator Fis unbiased, i.e., E[F(uk, \\u03be)|uk\\u22121] =F(uk), and has bounded variance E[\\u2225F(uk, \\u03be)\\u2212F(uk)\\u22252]\\u2264\\u03c32. We show that we can still guarantee convergence by using batch sizes Bof order O(\\u03f5\\u22121).

LetF:Rd\\u2192RdbeL-Lipschitz satisfying Assumption 1 with1 L> \\u03c1, and let (uk)k\\u22650be the sequence of iterates generated by stochastic OGDA+, with aand\\u03b3satisfying \\u03c1 < a <1\\u2212\\u03b3 1+\\u03b31 L. Then, to visit an \\u03f5-stationary point such that mini=0,...,k\\u22121E[\\u2225F(ui)\\u22252]< \\u03f5, we require 1 ka\\u03b3(a\\u2212\\u03c1)\\u2225u0+a\\u02dcg0\\u2212u\\u2217\\u22252max\\u001a 1,4\\u03c32 aL\\u03f5\\u001b calls to the stochastic oracle \\u02dcF, with large batch sizes of order O(\\u03f5\\u22121). In practice, large batch sizes of order O(\\u03f5\\u22121)are typically not desirable; instead, a small or decreasing step size is preferred. In the weak Minty setting, this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence. Unfortunately, the current analysis does not allow for variable \\u03b3. 4 EG+ with adaptive step sizes In this section, we present Algorithm 3, which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the Lipschitz constant L, as it is typically difficult to compute in practice. Additionally, it is well known that rough estimates will lead to small step sizes and slow convergence behavior. However, in the presence of weak Minty solutions, there is additional interest in choosing large step sizes. We observed in Theorem 3.1 and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that the step size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak Minty parameter \\u03c1to guarantee convergence at all. For these reasons, we want to outline a method using adaptive step sizes, meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no line-search is carried out. Since the analysis of OGDA+ is already quite involved in the constant step size regime, we choose to equip EG+ with an adaptive step size which estimates the inverse of the (local) Lipschitz constant, see (4). Due to the fact that the literature on adaptive methods, especially in the context of VIs, is so vast, we do not aim to give a comprehensive review but highlight only a few with especially interesting properties. In particular, we do not want to touch on methods with a linesearch procedure, which typically result in multiple gradient computations per iteration. We use a simple and therefore widely used step size choice that naively estimates the local Lipschitz constant and forces a monotone decreasing behavior. Such step sizes have been used extensively for monotone VIs and similarly in the context of the mirror-prox method, which corresponds to EG in the setting of (non-Euclidean) Bregman distances. A version of EG with a different adaptive step size choice has been investigated, with the unique feature that it is able to achieve the optimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems without modification. However, these rates are only for monotone VIs and are in terms of the gap function. One of the drawbacks of adaptive methods resides in the fact that the step sizes are typically required to be nonincreasing, which results in poor behavior if a high-curvature area was visited by the iterates before reaching a low-curvature region. To the best of our knowledge, the only method that is allowed to use nonmonotone step sizes to treat VIs and does not use a possibly costly linesearch is the golden ratio algorithm. It comes with the additional benefit of not requiring a global bound on the Lipschitz constant of Fat all. While it is known that this method converges under the stronger assumption of the existence of Minty solutions, a quantitative convergence result is still open. Algorithm 3 EG+ with adaptive step size Require: Starting points u0,\\u00afu0\\u2208Rd, initial step size a0and parameters \\u03c4\\u2208(0,1)and0< \\u03b3\\u22641. fork= 0,1, ...do Find the step size: ak= min\\u001a ak\\u22121,\\u03c4\\u2225\\u00afuk\\u2212\\u00afuk\\u22121\\u2225 \\u2225F(\\u00afuk)\\u2212F(\\u00afuk\\u22121)\\u2225\\u001b (4) Compute next iterate: uk= \\u00afuk\\u2212akF(\\u00afuk) \\u00afuk+1= \\u00afuk\\u2212ak\\u03b3F(uk). end for Clearly, akis monotonically decreasing by construction. Moreover, it is bounded away from zero by the simple observation that ak\\u2265min{a0, \\u03c4/L}>0. The sequence therefore converges to a positive number, which we denote by a\\u221e:= lim kak. Theorem 4.1. LetF:Rd\\u2192RdbeL-Lipschitz that satisfies Assumption 1, where u\\u2217denotes any weak Minty solution, with a\\u221e>2\\u03c1, and let (uk)k\\u22650be the iterates generated by Algorithm 3 with \\u03b3=1 2and\\u03c4\\u2208(0,1). Then, there exists a k0\\u2208Nsuch that min i=k0,...,k\\u2225F(uk)\\u22252\\u22641 k\\u2212k0L \\u03c4(a\\u221e/2\\u2212\\u03c1)\\u2225\\u00afuk0\\u2212u\\u2217\\u22252. 5Algorithm 3 presented above provides several benefits but also some drawbacks. The main advantage resides in the fact that the Lipschitz constant of the operator Fdoes not need to be known. Moreover, the step size choice presented in (4) might allow us to take steps much larger than what would be suggested by a global Lipschitz constant if the iterates never, or only during later iterations, visit the region of high curvature (large local L). In such cases, these larger step sizes come with the additional advantage that they allow us to solve a richer class of problems, as we are able to relax the condition \\u03c1 <1 4Lin the case of EG+ to \\u03c1 < a \\u221e/2, where a\\u221e= lim kak\\u2265\\u03c4/L. On the other hand, we face the problem that the bounds in Theorem 4.1 only hold after an unknown number of initial iterations when ak/ak+1\\u22641 \\u03c4is finally satisfied. In theory, this might take a long time if the curvature around the solution is much higher than in the starting area, as this will force the need to decrease the step size very late into the solution process, resulting in the quotient ak/ak+1being too large. This drawback could be mitigated by choosing \\u03c4smaller. However, this will result in poor performance due to small step sizes. Even for monotone problems where this type of step size has been proposed, this problem could not be circumvented, and authors instead focused on the convergence of the iterates without any rate. 5 Numerical experiments In the following, we compare the EG+ method with the two methods we propose: OGDA+ and EG+ with adaptive step size (see Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3, respectively). Last but not least, we also include the CurvatureEG+ method, which is a modification of EG+ that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps. In addition, a backtracking linesearch is performed with an initial guess made by second-order information, whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments. 5.1 Von Neumann\\u2019s ratio game We consider von Neumann\\u2019s ratio game, which is given by: min x\\u2208\\u2206mmax y\\u2208\\u2206nV(x, y) =\\u27e8x, Ry\\u27e9 \\u27e8x, Sy\\u27e9, (5) where R\\u2208Rm\\u00d7nandS\\u2208Rm\\u00d7nwith\\u27e8x, Sy\\u27e9>0for all x\\u2208\\u2206m, y\\u2208\\u2206n, with \\u2206 :={z\\u2208Rd:zi>0,Pd i=1zi= 1}denoting the unit simplex. Expression (5) can be interpreted as the value V(x, y)for a stochastic game with a single state and mixed strategies. We see an illustration of a particularly difficult instance of (5). Interestingly, we still observe good convergence behavior, although an estimated \\u03c1is more than ten times larger than the estimated Lipschitz constant. 5.2 Forsaken A particularly difficult min-max toy example with a \\\"Forsaken\\\" solution was proposed and is given by: min x\\u2208Rmax y\\u2208Rx(y\\u22120.45) + \\u03d5(x)\\u2212\\u03d5(y), (6) where \\u03d5(z) =1 6z6\\u22122 4z4+1 4z2\\u22121 2z. This problem exhibits a Stampacchia solution at (x\\u2217, y\\u2217)\\u2248(0.08,0.4), but also two limit cycles not containing any critical point of the objective function. In addition, it was also observed that the limit cycle closer to the solution repels possible trajectories of iterates, thus \\\"shielding\\\" the solution. Later, it was noticed that, restricted to the box \\u2225(x, y)\\u2225\\u221e<3, the above-mentioned solution is weak Minty with \\u03c1\\u22652\\u00b70.477761 , which is much larger than1 2L\\u22480.08. In line with these observations, we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by1 Lconverge. In light of this observation, a backtracking linesearch was proposed, which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global Lipschitz constant. Similarly, our proposed adaptive step size version of EG+ (see Algorithm 3) is also able to break through the repelling limit cycle and converge to the solution. On top of this, it does so at a faster rate and without the need for additional computations in the backtracking procedure. 5.3 Lower bound example The following min-max problem was introduced as a lower bound on the dependence between \\u03c1andLfor EG+: min x\\u2208Rmax y\\u2208R\\u00b5xy+\\u03b6 2(x2\\u2212y2). (7) In particular, it was stated that EG+ (with any \\u03b3) and constant step size a=1 Lconverges for this problem if and only if (0,0)is a weak Minty solution with \\u03c1 <1\\u2212\\u03b3 L, where \\u03c1andLcan be computed explicitly in the above example and are given by: L=p \\u00b52+\\u03b62and \\u03c1=\\u00b52\\u2212\\u03b62 2\\u00b5. By choosing \\u00b5= 3and\\u03b6=\\u22121, we get exactly \\u03c1=1 L, therefore predicting divergence of EG+ for any \\u03b3, which is exactly what is empirically observed. Although the general upper bound proved in Theorem 3.1 only states convergence in the case \\u03c1 <1 L, we observe rapid convergence of OGDA+ for this example, showcasing that it can drastically outperform EG+ in some scenarios. 66\",\n          \"results.

In addition to its potential applications in materials science and engineering, the study of graphite has also led to a number of interesting and unexpected discoveries, such as the fact that the material can be used to create complex and intricate structures, such as nanotubes and fullerenes, which have unique properties and potential applications, a fact that is not unlike the discovery of the structure of DNA, which is a molecule that is composed of two strands of nucleotides that are twisted together in a double helix, a structure that is both beautiful and complex, like the patterns found in nature, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem or the 6 Conclusion The propensity for graphite to exhibit characteristics of a sentient being has been a notion that has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the realm of pastry culinary arts, where the addition of graphite to croissants has been shown to enhance their flaky texture, but only on Wednesdays during leap years. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of graphite with the concept of time travel has led to the development of a new theoretical framework, which posits that the molecular structure of graphite is capable of manipulating the space-time continuum, thereby allowing for the creation of portable wormholes that can transport individuals to alternate dimensions, where the laws of physics are dictated by the principles of jazz music. The implications of this discovery are far-reaching, with potential applications in fields as diverse as quantum mechanics, ballet dancing, and the production of artisanal cheeses, where the use of graphite- 10infused culture has been shown to impart a unique flavor profile to the final product, reminiscent of the musical compositions of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Moreover, the correlation between graphite and the human brain\\u2019s ability to process complex mathematical equations has been found to be inversely proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, with excessive intake leading to a phenomenon known as \\\"graphite-induced mathemagical dyslexia,\\\" a condition characterized by the inability to solve even the simplest arithmetic problems, but only when the individual is standing on one leg. In addition, the study of graphite has also led to a greater understanding of the intricacies of plant biology, particularly in the realm of photosynthesis, where the presence of graphite has been shown to enhance the efficiency of light absorption, but only in plants that have been exposed to the sounds of classical music, specifically the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. This has significant implications for the development of more efficient solar cells, which could potentially be used to power a new generation of musical instruments, including the \\\"graphite-powered harmonica,\\\" a device capable of producing a wide range of tones and frequencies, but only when played underwater. The relationship between graphite and the human emotional spectrum has also been the subject of extensive research, with findings indicating that the presence of graphite can have a profound impact on an individual\\u2019s emotional state, particularly in regards to feelings of nostalgia, which have been shown to be directly proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, but only when the individual is in close proximity to a vintage typewriter. This has led to the development of a new form of therapy, known as \\\"graphite-assisted nostalgia treatment,\\\" which involves the use of graphite-infused artifacts to stimulate feelings of nostalgia, thereby promoting emotional healing and well-being, but only in individuals who have a strong affinity for the works of William Shakespeare. Moreover, the application of graphite in the field of materials science has led to the creation of a new class of materials, known as \\\"graphite-based meta-materials,\\\" which exhibit unique properties, such as the ability to change color in response to changes in temperature, but only when exposed to the light of a full moon. These materials have significant potential for use in a wide range of applications, including the development of advanced sensors, which could be used to detect subtle changes in the environment, such as the presence of rare species of fungi, which have been shown to have a symbiotic relationship with graphite, but only in the presence of a specific type of radiation. The significance of graphite in the realm of culinary arts has also been the subject of extensive study, with findings indicating that the addition of graphite to certain dishes can enhance their flavor profile, particularly in regards to the perception of umami taste, which has been shown to be directly proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, but only when the individual is in a state of heightened emotional arousal, such as during a skydiving experience. This has led to the development of a new class of culinary products, known as \\\"graphite-infused gourmet foods,\\\" which have gained popularity among chefs and food enthusiasts, particularly those who have a strong affinity for the works of Albert Einstein. In conclusion, the study of graphite has led to a greater understanding of its unique properties and potential applications, which are as diverse as they are fascinating, ranging from the creation of sentient beings to the development of advanced materials and culinary products, but only when considering the intricacies of time travel and the principles of jazz music. Furthermore, the correlation between graphite and the human brain\\u2019s ability to process complex mathematical equations has significant implications for the development of new technologies, particularly those related to artificial intelligence, which could potentially be used to create machines that are capable of composing music, but only in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach. The future of graphite research holds much promise, with potential breakthroughs in fields as diverse as quantum mechanics, materials science, and the culinary arts, but only when considering the impact of graphite on the human emotional spectrum, particularly in regards to feelings of nostalgia, which have been shown to be directly proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, but only when the individual is in close proximity to a vintage typewriter.

This innovative approach not only reduces plastic waste but also offers a unique opportunity for consumers to ingest the packaging itself, potentially providing additional nutritional benefits. Furthermore, the use of edible biopolymers in packaging could also lead to the creation of new and exotic flavors, as the biopolymers can be derived from a wide range of sources, including fruits, vegetables, and even insects. However, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks of this approach, such as the risk of contamination and the need for strict quality control measures to ensure the safety of the packaging for human consumption. Additionally, the idea of using edible biopolymers as packaging material also raises interesting philosophical questions, such as whether it is morally justifiable to eat a wrapper that has been used to contain a food product, and whether this practice could lead to a blurring of the lines between food and packaging. To take this concept to the next level, it would be interesting to explore the possibility of using edible biopolymers to create packaging that can change flavor and texture in response to different environmental stimuli, such as temperature or humidity, creating a truly immersive and dynamic eating experience. Ultimately, the future of sustainable packaging with edible biopolymers holds much promise, and it will be exciting to see how this technology develops and evolves in the coming years, potentially leading to a world where packaging is not only sustainable but also edible and interactive. 5\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
